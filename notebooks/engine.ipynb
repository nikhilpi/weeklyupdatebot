I think those areas deserve better prioritization which will be the subject of a lot of discussions and thinking this week. My bias is that we should swing heavily towards engagement and setting ambitious goals there. To even hit 73k would have been considered an extremely ambitious goal in January, and thats why I think its not overly ambitious to aim to get 50% of our contractors doing at least 1 loan by the end of next quarter [or perhaps even sooner]. At a high level that would be at least 1500 loans by the end of next quarter [assuming that we're near 3000 total contractors at that time]. Looking forward to getting everyones thoughts and ideas this week.\\n\\nOther than that it seems like self serve is making a huge come back, thanks in major part to David Z's excellent observation that self serve stopped when we removed pricing from the landing page. Thank you for that DZ! Exciting week ahead, with the trade show in Las Vegas in the first two days. I'm also looking forward to a trip out to Austin where we'll start to map out the move for our new office there, and potentially interview some new candidates that can focus on driving the outbound channel. Happy to share more of my thinking here for anyone who is curious. The long and short of it is that if we can make outbound sales profitable then thats a hugely scalable channel that we can leverage to grow faster and more consistently.\\n\\nAlso we're going to get some signal on our first direct mail test this week, which is exciting! And, of course, see the fruit of Christopher's tireless labor restructuring our backend unique identification system, great job there Christopher, really looking forward to that going out.\\n\\nHope you all have a good weekend!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

I\\'d like to start by giving a huge shout out to Scott and the entire sales team for pulling us out of a slump and delivering an exceptional month. Now, I think that we could deliver even more in the future, but there were a couple of key things that stood out to me this month. The first was the culture and energy of the sales team which was unparalleled, especially coming off of a disappointing\\xa0July. I saw people coming in early, staying late, training through lunch, coming in on satudays -- what I saw was a lot of people who absolutely refused to take a loss this month, and that came through in the final numbers. There is so much that goes into this, but really strong effort in particular from Sales this month. I\\'d also like to recognize CS for their work around retention and on-boarding which will be visible to us in the coming weeks, I think we\\'re already seeing much better churn numbers for this point in the month than we have ever seen before.\\n\\nIn SF we had the pleasure of welcoming both Ben and Katie to our team! Welcome both of you, we\\'re excited to have you.\\n\\nOn the product and engineering side we\\'re starting to see some results from our path to 10 test. The data is extremely early but it looks like for our cohort that has the \"launch plan\" and has had the product for two weeks, the % of that cohort that has funded is 3.3x higher for those with the launch plan UI versus those without. Its early and the numbers are small, but this is a really good sign and its visible throughout the other top of the funnel metrics. Excited to see that track.\\n\\nNow comes the last month of the quarter, lets take everything we\\'ve learned and crush it this month!\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We did it ! Amazing work across the board - a special shout out has to go to Scott and sales for their 11th hour come back. Incredible. We’re setting new heights for the company every week. We got a lot done. I could make a list here of all the amazing things that happened this week across the company but I feel that sometimes numbers are worth a thousand words. 2 million run rate, 2 years in. Let’s get it!\\n\\nI can’t leave it at that if I’m being honest there was just too much amazing amazing work. First we welcomed 3 new members to our Austin Customer Success Team - welcome! We also had Jonah join our inside sales team - welcome, Jonah! Shea, Drew, Clayton and Scott [Jr.] *crushed* outbound and have shown what’s possible. Hard to over exaggerate how important their work this month will be for the company going forward. This is the ultimate channel, and proving it out with little to no optimization is an incredible signal regarding what’s possible. As well as a feat of will power and ingenuity on their part for making it work.\\n\\nEngineering released app v1.5 and built 1.6, with product and marketing’s help that means we’re going to see invoicing [already live] as well as gamification and know before you go in the app as soon as early this week. On the BD front, we executed our agreement with Prosper to take over their HomeAdvisor relationship and I expect that we’ll sign the Buildzoom deal Monday or Tuesday. We’ve submitted the official deal documents to AMS financial regarding a purchase, and I’m headed out there Wednesday to meet with them in person - expect more on this. Zooming out, we hit 2 years which is a big milestone but also just the very beginning! We set goals for the next quarter which I will be sharing once we finalize all of the drpartment OKR’s. Looking forward to being in Austin at the end of this week.\\n\\nSorry for the shorter than usual note there is a huge virus/cold spreading around the SF office that has a couple of us out cold this weekend.\\n\\nWe did it guys.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Next week we have a lot on our plate.\\n\\nLooks like the core loan brokerage is growing although there are a couple of hiccups that are worth looking into including the reduced complete rates. As far as qualified leads, there seems to be a lot of growth coming from all channels which is a very positive sign. Looking like we\\'re going to grow around 30% in terms of QL\\'s this month, which means we\\'ll cross the $100 million annualized number as far as qualified leads. The key focus remains closing loans. This next period of 10 days will be critical in terms of determining whether our bottom of the funnel tests come through, as we usually see loans close in the first and last 10 days of the month. So far we\\'re tracking at 5 closed loans, which is a little lower than we were hoping for, as we\\'re aiming for 35 this month. We have yet to close any marketplace loans, but hopefully the new buildzoom test will yield fruit -- we had some high intent clicks coming off buildzoom in the last week so we shall see whether or not they come through.\\n\\nLots of progress in terms of making our product a more comprehensive credit platform this week, with the addition of freedom debt relief, and lending tree just on the edge of closing. Figuring out how to monetize our traffic is now the key goal for the quarter, so leveraging existing funnels to cross sell users who are not interested in personal loans will be important. I think one way we can do this is through e-mail, which we\\'re auditing this week. The second way is through text, which has been pretty useful in that it solicits a lot of responses [the majority of which are claims that the rates are too high]. The third way is through calling, which we have not done in earnest for a while. We\\'re going to be revisiting all three of these bottom of the funnel/ post funnel tactics this week. This paired with the lead CRM will help us streamline the closing process as well as get us closer to our users.\\n\\nContractor acquisition is going well, with a lot of initiative going into the early February roofing expo. This week will be a big one for mapping out and building a lot of our contractor facing website. We\\'ll sync up on all of this next week.\\n\\nBig big win for us in the California license, we had a couple of QL\\'s come in from our California e-mail [which went out to everyone who had applied through us in california] hopefully that can get us closer to our end of the month target. Special shout out to vitarelli who led us through the \"Kafkaesque\" licensing process with the DBO. Now we officially have a nation wide platform. The more important piece with respect to California, is that it allows us to get closer to our users. Where before we had to travel to sign on contractors or visit our users, now we can do so within the state which should materially advance our understanding of potential customers.\\n\\nI did some work on user identification this week which John and Jakub are going to build on to give us a better understanding of who is converting and what cohorts to target. Brandon is also doing great work here through facebook where we\\'re launching a new test.\\n\\nOnwards and upwards!\\xa0 The first couple of weeks of the quarter have gone great, thank you all for your focus and energy. Lots more to do.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We got around 80 people to sign up for our open house which was really great, some really talented people there -- lots of them knew Jakub [A.K.A da-Kub] and were excited about the fact that he was working with us which made me happy and proud of what we're building! Although we're not hiring for full time engineers at the moment, its always good to have a strong pipeline of talent. I mentioned a fall and winter internship to a couple of the people I really liked and they seemed amenable to it, so if we can find someone who can fill the big shoes left by Scott, I'm definitely open to it.\\n\\nLast week was probably one of the most successful weeks in the company's short history. That being said I have to start at the end by calling out Will for doing a phenomenal job putting together an amazing off-site for us. Sorry to everyone who got sick, the drivers described the waters are calm, but I assume thats all relative! It was especially great having Jacob Simon there, who I know we're all really excited about. He'll be joining us two mondays from now, so he's ready to hit the ground running. I think he's going to be a great addition to the team. On that note we're also getting ready to welcome David, our new designer to the team. David brings a lot of experience and a great perspective to the company. Andrew Nelson really taught us how to work with a designer -- and taught me to see design as an equal part to marketing, engineering, product in terms of communicating with the customer. He'll be instrumental in increasing our iteration speed and give us more bandwidth to chat with new partners and map things out.\\n\\nOn the legal side thanks to the work of Mr. Vitarelli and Matthews we nailed the Joe and Drew fingerprints, which was no easy task so we're ready to file for licenses in our core states. Not to mention we launched in 3 more states [including Alabama [Roll Tide!]].\\n\\nOn the BD side I think we had a lot of strategic validation -- we signed an NDA with IAC to explore a partnership with HomeAdvisor Angie's List, we are well on our way to a pilot with Paintzen which should be exciting, I also spoke to the head of BD at Porch who wants us to send him a deck with a mock up and seems interested in exploring a partnership. On the insurance side we have NDA's underway with Hippo thanks to Shannon's great work and Liberty Mutual. I spoke to liberty mutual about getting something up and running by the end of the quarter and they seemed to think a lead generation partnership [in which we send them emails we collect off of the quiz flow and they pay us on a per-lead basis] was possible by late August. So we are on track for an insurance beta of some sort by the end of the quarter. Even more exciting on the insurance side, they seemed interested in exploring a bespoke product that we can design to insure remodels -- meaning that people can get insurance policies that cover and deficiencies associated with new build on their real estate. This is pretty huge and would be an incredible competitive differentiation with respect to talking to these marketplaces. This week my biggest priority is to prepare for the insurance test I'm taking two tuesdays from now. Unfortunately I did not get around to doing 20 hours of studying this week, but I plan to do much more than that in the coming week. Thats a key priority for me so that we can hopefully get licensed by the end of the month, if not a couple days after that.\\n\\nEngineering did great work last week -- we saw some of it at the product meeting. The big consumer facing things were the website redesign and setting up for our new test around LTV messaging on buildzoom. We've still got to figure out how to capture e-mail off the flow, but a key for us is to stay disciplined and focused WHILE being experimental and expansive. Its a tough line to walk, but one that I think we're managing relatively well.\\n\\nLots more going on that I'm likely skimming over -- Brandon's been manning the cannons on the marketing side well, we got a couple of big backlinks last week as well as the new copy.\\n\\n.. all this in four days. Pretty great.\\n\\nWe are tracking fairly well towards our goals for the end of the quarter, its early but I loved the momentum this week. Lets keep it up and keep moving and pushing hard, the opportunity is in front of us and its ours to capture. Looking forward to seeing you all bright and early tomorrow!\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

This next quarter is going to put everything we've built to date to a serious test. Scaling our systems, passing our values on to new members of the team, and serving a broad [and opinionated] set of customers is going to test us as a company but also individually. Remember -- all the pitfalls are not specific to you. When you see things that frustrate you or could be better, speak out. These insights are the most valuable pieces of information to us as we continue to build the company out in an intentional way. \\n\\nAlso,\\xa0 get some rest before we kick things off on Monday.\\xa0\\n\\nI've taken the conversation we had about quarterly targets into consideration, and my view is that we get there by shooting for 60k revenue in April. I've spent a good amount of time over the weekend mapping out what needs to be true for us to hit the rest of it, and I'm looking forward to sharing that broadly next week with a mind towards turning those high level metrics into actionable department specific goals.\\xa0\\n\\n30k this month is not important for what it represents in absolute terms, its important for what it represents in terms of the potential of the company, and the velocity with which we can achieve that potential. We have 200 contractors, which is 0.005% of the number of licensed contractors buildzoom has in its database. We're at the tip of the iceberg. The key will be acquiring more of these contractors in way that ensures the longevity of the company and serving them in a way that we'd all be proud to own and be related to.\\xa0\\n\\nGreat goal setting meeting, looking forward to discussing the plans in more detail with everyone tomorrow.\\xa0\\n\\nIn the mean time have a wonderful weekend!\\n\\nWarmly,\\xa0\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman\"),\n",

Spent a lot of time this weekend thinking through what we need to accomplish over the course of the next two months in order to hit our ambitious sales goals. These last two weeks have been a bit crazy with the combination of July 4th, changing our entire facebook campaign and increasing prices more than 2x. I think we invited a lot of pain and uncertainty by pulling all of these triggers at the same time, so it was expected that this would be a period of some chaos. The idea is that we will use this chaos to establish order, by uncovering the governing dynamics of acquisition under the new conditions -- higher prices -- and then ultimately leveraging them to drive future growth. There are many lenses through which we can look at whats going on the business and try to figure out whether or not we\\'ll be able to scale a profitable software company here. At the highest leverage of abstraction, I try to reduce things down to mid term goals. Long term goals can be instructive but they unfortunately dont have much in the way of planning power as a lot can happen, and the points of horizon can change for good reason. The mid term lens I use takes us to the end of 2019. My view is that by the end of 2019 we can develop a base of at least 12,000 contractors. There are roughly one million contractors out there [its hard to get actual numbers here, ibis world says there are 700,000, but buildzoom counts 4m licenses, I generally use 1m in my thinking]. As of today, with our new pricing, we can expect an Average Annual Contract Value of around $840 purely on subscription. 12,000 contractors gets us to around $10,000,000 in ARR, or recurring subscription. With our new channel line up, we will have exposure to many more than 12,000 contractors, and my view is that we through iteration and fine tuning our product and messaging, we can build towards this goal. In fact I think that we can achieve that before the end of 2019, but the end of 2019 feels like a fair goal post to set. Part of the logic of changing the pricing was that it reduced the number of contractors we\\'d need to acquire to get to $10m ARR. If you think about it simply, we\\'d need around 25-30k contractors to achieve this with our old pricing, and my suspicion is that we\\'re going to see lower churn at our new price point, given that we\\'ll be attracting a more curated and established group of contractors. The chaos that I mentioned around the top of the funnel, also gives us extra time to focus on the product itself [hence the seats launch, the re-engagement campaigns and the aggressive CS interviewing/hiring]. We went from having to manage an additional 80 contractors a week to 30. I think we can get back up to 80 or more shortly, in the next 4 weeks or so, with our new pricing. This means that we have a bit of lead time to sort out the engagement part of the business. Unfortunately, motivating the inactive to use the product is going to be a difficult challenge for us as an organization. I really appreciate Anthony Vitarelli, Stephanie and Maira calling our inactive contractors as a first step. Hopefully this translates into our first meaningful tick up in terms of new referring contractors in our base. We\\'ve seen a slow and steady increase, but its been far too slow to get us to our 20% inactive target and has largely been a consequence of the decrease in top of the funnel\\xa0+ churning inactive accounts. This was not a problem I think anyone expected to be able to solve in 2 weeks, but it is a problem that we\\'ve been taking a relatively systematic approach to solving. One of the initiatives I\\'m excited about is sending packets of homeowner fliers to inactive contractors. I suspect this will help them generate more interest in our product, this will go out to around 100 contractors this coming week. Seats is an excellent initiative because it brings us closer to the end user and solves the problem in principal of a disconnect between the owner [buyer] and the sales rep [user]. I think the more embedded into the salespersons workflow we are the more consistently we can expect completed applications from our contractors. And this is a big deal, as a calculation of the number of qualified leads /dollars we made from contractor loans indicates that a qualified lead from contractors are worth around $30 a piece! I think we can boost this further by optimizing our bottom of the funnel loan options demonstration and favoring loans that we think will close based both on their terms and the lenders propensity to fund loans on the backend. My view is that we can get a siginificant lift through this work.\\n\\nThere is also a lot going on at the top of the funnel, the main new channels for us right now are outbound and the channel partnerships. Kevin has been doing a great job aligning strategy for the channel partnerships, and I\\'m eager to see what Madsky yields when we launch the first campaign next week.On the other hand, we have outbound sales which is experiencing some normal and expected growing pains around instrumentation but is showing some promise. Outbound sales is the ultimate channel, in that if we can make it work, scaling acquisition becomes a lot more predictable and there is a very well developed framework for building outbound sales teams. There has been a lot of excellent work on this front, the sales team has been consistently pounding out nearly 100 calls a day per person. Special recognition goes to Drew who has truly been crushing it, this week he closed two 598 outbound sales in one day. Scott and the team in Austin are paving a new vertical for growth. One facebook, we\\'re expecting to see some meaningful improvement as we\\'re bringing on some experts to run our campaigns. This will be a team that is specialized in the facebook channel, and more specifically scaling campaigns significantly. They have a great track record and were recommended to me by the founder of Thumbtack who claims that they helped his wife grow her sales from 1m run rate to 10m run rate in one month. I do not expect this will happen for us, but if we can even get a double out of it it will be more than worth what we are paying them. We shall see.\\n\\nI heard a fantastic quote recently that went something like \"a company is a series of of increasingly granular pivots\". I think this is very true, at first the pivots are extremely dramatic -- like the decision to go from being a direct lender to a brokerage. Subsequently they get more granular, to go from marketplace inter-mediation to contractor inter-mediation, to go from a free contractor product to a paid contractor product, to go from home improvement generally to the specific sub verticals where we have high conviction. The precondition to a pivot [at this stage] is hypothesis testing. There is no playbook for how to grow our business, but the beautiful thing is that there are a lot of different ways of doing so. As a company, more important than any short term goal or quarterly objective, is going to be setting the company up in a way where we are really good at iterating. As stated, the pre-condition to iterating [or taking these pivots] is being in a testing posture, which means having internal mechanisms for evaluating different opportunities for signal [i.e outbound sales, re-engagement e-mails, re-engagement texts, re-engagement calls, channel partnerships]. When I evaluate where we are as a company I index heavily on things like are we being flexible enough, are we testing enough, are we collecting signals on needle moving strategies enough. This strategy is not too dissimilar from seed investing, where you essentially bet on multiple different companies and then double down on the ones that work. There is always a time shortly after you make the bet, and before it starts to work [or fail] where things look chaotic and uncertain. But the uncertainty is the nature of hypothesis testing, you cant have certainty and a hypothesis, these things contradict each other. Similarly, you shouldnt have hypothesis testing in the absence of measurement, which is why instrumentation is so deeply ciritcal to our stage as a company, and why in large part we\\'re all so excited for Michael Venman to start to bring more direct clarity to our organization through Salesforce.\\n\\nThats it for my opining this weekend! See you all tomorrow.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Disappointing finish to the month last month, we faced a lot headwinds — But headwinds are no excuse —we Came in a bit short relative to where we wanted to be, and we dont want to see any more reduction in our overall performance as a company. There are bright spots, for the first time as we focus more on engagement we’re seeing a lot of improvements in terms of our user engagement while we’re starting to encounter rocky waters with our new customer acquisition. Even though we had a down month by about 30k relative to may, thats about a 6% reduction in cash income, which is not as big as it feels if you think about it proportionately. That being said, there is no reason that this winning team should not be posting 20% improvements versus marginal reductions in our overall performance.\\n\\nAugust is our chance to fix that. I want August to be the best month the company has ever had by every metric. What does that mean? That means in August I want to bring in more accounts than we ever have before, I want us to engage and onboard more of our customers than we ever have before, I want us to help more people find suitable insurance policies than we ever have before. I dont see anything stopping us from achieving those things. The only barrier I foresee is our mindset as a company and how we approach challenges. We went for many months without seeing any serious hiccups in our business — Posting enormous growth month after month. So a couple of bad months can play with our sense that we are a winning team and that we are driving real value for our customers. The important thing to remember is that we can do this. This company has been defined by all of the times we faced challenges, stood up to them and overcame them far beyond anyone’s expectations (even our own many times). Every single person in this company was selected to be here, and I want every single one of you to bring your best to the table this month. Lets set new highs for the company and new standards for ourselves internally. We are going to refuse to take no for an answer this month.\\n\\nNo excuses in August, just new records. Thats the company that we’re all here to build and thats the company that we will build together.\\n\\nOur product is streamlined, we have a game plan, we have the right people — Now its time to execute. I want all hands on deck! Lets do this!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We're firing on all cylinders. It was great to be in Austin with the team Monday through Wednesday, I especially enjoyed being able to share some fundamentals about our product/market as well as high level overview of the company and our new hype video. Across the board things are improving there and I'm glad to be able to see each team across all departments becoming sharper, more positive and proactive. I think we'll continue to see that trend as long as we're constantly surfacing any problems or areas for improvement. I unfortunately missed Rachael's lunch and learn but I heard great things about it.\\n\\nBack in San Francisco there are a couple of key projects we're moving forward. We had a productive session on the product side figuring out how we're going to improve on our latest offers page as well as streamlining the process for gathering information relating to insurance. I've personally had the chance to meet with a couple of more prospective investors about financing our next round and it seems that everyone is quite excited to partner with us through this next growth phase. Its interesting because there are specific ways in which I did not even realize how strong our business was until they came up through investors -- things like payback period (how long it takes us to make our money back after acquiring a contractor) and gross margin (how much it costs us to service our customers post sale) -- are extremely attractive although they were not neccesarily frames of reference we engaged when building the business. The real question that I've been thinking a lot about is how do we build this business 20x -- into a 100m a year business. I think we can do that within home improvement, although I think there is also a potentially faster path by building parallel businesses that are essentially mirrors of our home improvement strategy in other verticals. Either way there is on thing that is absolutely clear and that is that the business has a lot of room to grow! Speaking of which, we had a relatively slow start in Austin this month and I'm looking forward to us having a couple of record breaking weeks in front of us.\\n\\nBrandon has been hard at work trying to make sure we have a rockstar performance in June for outbound and I'm confident that his strategy and work will pay off when the time comes. As part of that we've brought on a contractor who some of you may know (aaron from outbound) who should start as soon as monday. We've also engaged Sales360 which is a unicor alternative to see if we can drive more efficiency. Finally, we've started to instrument (measure) unicor's performance more rigorously as well as increased their alignment by improving the spiff we give them when one of our teammates closes a lead that they passed over. I think this and a couple of the other projects we've moved forward on the sales side should give us strong tailwind.\\n\\nI've spent a lot of the weekend digging up old numbers and putting together some information about the company -- its been a wild ride so far! One thing is clear -- there is a simple ingredient to getting from where we are to where we want to go: dont give up!\\n\\nWith that I'll give you small token I was able to dig up. We launched our first product in April of 2017 expecting that it was going to be making us ten million dollars by the end of the year. Instead we got 0, and the next month we got another 0, the month after that we got 0 too. So we went three months with nothing, but we were working hard and testing a lot out to see what could possibly work to get people to take loans through websites like buildzoom. Then finally on July 18th we closed our first loan (our first revenue ever was in July 2017). We found out because I texted one of our contacts at SoFi. Its pretty funny here is the exchange: the bad news was that we had only done one loan -- which to us of course was reason to celebrate!\"),\n",

The first and most important being us hitting our quarterly goal -- 20k in a month for March. What a long road it has been, we should all feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment at this. We know what it took to get here. Its amazing how much easier it is getting from 10k to 20k vs getting from 0 to 10k. We've got a tremendous amount of positive momentum going on this front. We also had the great pleasure of having Scott join us and crush it in his first week here! Cheers to you Scott, we're so excited to have you. On top of that Anthony Vitarelli brought in Stephanie who I know we're all extremely excited about to run Customer Success on our end and finally we signed the long pending Thumbtack partnership that is kicking off early next week. We also crossed the 250k run rate milestone, which is a big deal, given that it was only last month [less than 30 days ago I believe] that we crossed the 100k milestone. Now on to bigger milestones, am I right???\\xa0\\n\\nHere is the important thing about all of this: we need to stay disciplined. We're so used to grinding for every penny, that its easy to look at this and say hey we did it. But we're still at 1% of what this company could be. Buildzoom reported that they have over 3 million contractors in their data base, that means this market may be *a lot* bigger than what we initially envisioned. Not only that, there is a multibillion dollar opportunity in insurance distribution by itself. There is still a ton of work to do in managing and engaging our contractors and there is broad consensus that we're on the brink of a financial recession the likes of which may be on the scale of 2008. I think of it like us being on a windy beach and spending over a year trying to tinder a fire. For the last six months we've been hitting spark after spark and now we've finally got a small flame going, but guess what -- its windy as hell out there. So we need to protect and nurture this thing in order to grow it into the roaring fire that we all want it to be. To do this we need to stay together, stay strong and keep working the same way we were working when it was just a small spark. You heard it from Joe when he was here -- its all about keeping this group strong, this team working together and avoiding the many pitfalls of growth, one of which I spoke about two state of the start ups ago.\\xa0\\n\\nI hate to be the guy who sees a goal and says OK we hit it whats next. Its important that we celebrate our wins, and this is a \\n\\nAll that being said -- I hope everyone is getting some rest and putting their thinking caps on as the week ahead will be critical in terms of defining the milestone for next quarter. In addition, we're going to have to do some heavy lifting to get Thumbtack kick started [who would have thought we'd struggle to keep pace with them].\\xa0\\n\\nGodspeed everyone!\\xa0\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman\"),\n",

I'm also very excited about what we're doing with the flow, adding credit cards in etc. I think we're progressing really well, and I appreciate all the great work this week.\\n\\nOn the subject of product development -- I think we've done a much better job this week fostering an inclusive debate about the direction and iterations. Thank you to everyone who participated. I like having the meeting go an hour and a half, I think its working quite well.\\n\\nExcited to push a bunch of important things forward next week. Chief amongst them being the new funnel iteration with credit cards. I think we still have some work to do in terms of actually making sure we're keeping track of the call scheduling and calling people at the right time. More broadly, I'm very curious to see how the drip integration with buildzoom and paintzen work out. I have a sense that these could be really important pieces. I'm enthused about the data we've gotten back from facebook too. Things are spinning on all axes w/r to the core loan brokerage and I'm happy about it.\\n\\nI've spent a lot of this week looking forward. I think that we're likely to go for this 1-2 million dollar raise this quarter. Additionally, I've spent a good bit of time working with Realtor.com and a couple of other channel partnership for Q1. I just got an intro to \\n\\nporch.com which could be exciting, and I'm planning to hit up our friends at IAC when I'm back east in November. I had a great conversation with a gentleman from greensky who told be more about the company. Chief amongst the results of that conversation is a new emerging conversation with the team at Pell windows. Apparently Greensky's entire business is based on a channel partnership with anderson windows -- see it as a buildzoom had buildzoom worked out the way we expected from the beginning. Although he did mention that it took greensky a year to get ramped up with anderson [so these things naturally take time to get right]. Pell is larger than anderson, and I got connected to someone on their board earlier this week. Other than that still focused on trying to move this brick and mortar piece along. We scheduled my speech at dFree in November too, so hoping that that will give us a bump in closed loans before the close of the quarter and position us well for the next year.\\n\\nLooking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

As we went over in the state of the start up, I think we're starting to get a lot of interesting top of the funnel traction in terms of Pro.com, Roofr, Thumbtack and others. I just got off the phone with someone on the board of Pella, and he was really compelled by the 50% approval rate that our product can bring merchants. He's going to bring it up at his Board meeting in early November, and perhaps organize a meeting with the people who focus on remodeling at Kohler [a lot more bathroom style work]. He said they think they lose 70% of their customers because of financing, meaning that a good comprehensive financing product can triple their business. They work with greensky and mentioned that they werent satisfied with the product and what it was doing for their sales. So overall it was a really productive conversation. We are going to learn a lot about the BD sales piece of the business this quarter as running through all these merchants will teach us what messaging resonates and what doesnt. Overall it seems that people are at least somewhat convinced by the value proposition.\\n\\nOne of the things we discussed at State of the Startup was how we think about the goals for this quarter. I want to share the goals I've communicated to the board below and am curious for your feedback/thoughts.\\n\\n1. Close 100 Loans: This was planned as a 20, 35, 50 originally. Where we'd do 200 QL's this month, 350 next and 500 in december. This assumes a close rate of 10%. Our historic close rate is about 7%, and I figured that if we played with the bottom of the funnel we could bring it up. I think there is still a lot of low hanging fruit here that we havent tried and want to do a strategy session with Nikhil and whoever else to come up with ideas as it looks like we may be lagging on this front.That I know of we only have 3 closed loans this month. More may come in by the end of the month, and we still dont have reporting from Lendkey. The reason I set this as a goal is that if we get to 50 closed loans by the end of the year, we'll be at over 100k run rate which I think will be a good sign in terms of traction.\\n\\n2. 500 Qualified Leads a month in December: Above\\n\\n3. Sell 5 Credit Cards: It turns out this one may be easier than we expected. The goal was just to prove out that this was a use case and that there was demand. I'm really happy about the traction we've seen here so far, although I think we're going to have to marry that excitement with a better understanding of what the economics of driving traffic this way look like.\\n\\n4. Licensed in CA, TX, NJ, OH, CT and NC for Loan Brokerage. CA license for secured. CA, TX, PA, FL, NY and WA licesned for HHIS: We're pretty far on this one. The only wrinkle may be in the unsecured brokerage license [CFL] in California. Its looking like they are asking us for some difficult information but as Anthony described on Friday, we're watching closely and learning.\\n\\n5. Keep burn at 200k: This one is going to be marginally more difficult than I originally thought. I think we may be able to keep it under 220k. The main projects that are causing us to go over fall under legal and marketing, both of which are key levers for growing the business and learning more about the market, so it becomes a very fine balancing act. We have just under 20 months of run way at this rate which is quite healthy, with the potential to expand it closer to 30 with the note we're contemplating. We're by no means in a dire place, but its important that we all stay conscious of it and try to get our arms around it where we can.\\n\\n6. Potentially raise a note: As I mentioned, I think there is enough momentum to raise 2m or so on a note at a slightly higher cap than we had raised at before -- around 24 pre. This would mean that investors would get 2/26% of the company in exchange for 2 million dollars.\\n\\n7. Invest heavily in SEO, Brick & Mortar and Direct Mail: We've been doing a ton more on this front, and I'm excited about the early results.\\n\\n8. Create 50 accounts: This has been tracking pretty well, although I think the product roadmap will clarify how we're investing in the platform versus the loan options flow.\\n\\nA little bit of a slow month, compared to before in terms of QL's and closed loans, but we've made a ton of progress on the product and in potentially figuring out new channels. I think that we're on track to beat our QL numbers from last month, with a bit of luck we'll get a couple of more loans too. I've been calling customers that have applied with our partners but havent closed yet. I'm encouraged by the customer intelligence we got from Brandon's Direct Mail campaign as well as the fact that we're bringing in potential customers to play with the new flow [thank you to John and Zak for pushing that out so quickly]. I'm curious to hear how they receive it.\\n\\nIn the background, we're continuing to move things forward on the Realtor.com side and are on track to get a pilot agreement signed this quarter. I'm working with one of our investors to circle back at Houzz and see what happened there/ if it'll be possible to reengage that piece of the conversation. Paintzen is a bit slower to iterate than I would have liked but I still think they serve as a good signal for the company and hopefully we can get there over time. They have a pretty expansive network of pro's and if we had a brick and mortar product, I think there would be the potential to deepen the partnership.\\n\\nHope everyone is in good spirits over the weekend. We have a lot to push ahead next week.\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

I\\'m going into February very optimistic about what is to come. I think we\\'re gaining more control over the bottom of the funnel as we come to understand what upstream behaviors indicate conversion likelihood. I also think we\\'ve done a great job expanding the product this month, we added Lending Tree, Texting, Freedom Debt Relief and dramatically improved our email campaigns as well as segmented them depending on user characteristics and behavior on our side. I\\'m hoping all of this will lead to a higher conversion rate at the bottom of the funnel across all categories and that will be reflected in an increased amount of revenue next month. The first month, in my opinion, was massively stifled by the failed points iteration, but at least we have a strong view of what caused the decline and have addressed it which I hope to influence our performance next month. We saw solid credit card growth last month, with revenue going from $92.6 to $150, and January was the first month we\\'d made any mortgage revenue which is a big change and an exciting new field. We closed $173,770 in loans this month versus $173,249 last month which is disappointing but I think you can trace that back to the high intent click rate and the quantity of high intent clicks -- which only increased by 8% from December to January despite otherwise massive growth we saw at the top of the funnel [in short I think points caused our revenue not to increase this month in line with the overall growth]. The things that are most exciting to me from the month really have to do with the channel mix. Where last month 8 of the 9 loans we closed came from paid channels [6 from facebook, 1 from google 1 from bing], this month we had 12 closed with only 50% coming from paid and 50% coming from unpaid, Buildzoom, \"hearth\" and SEO. Also, despite our 90% growth in qualified leads, we managed to improve our channel mix MoM. In December we had 51% of QL\\'s come from paid channels, and in January we had only 38% despite that overall number being a lot higher. What this tells me is that we\\'ve become good at solving the traffic > Qualified lead conversion game and now we must maintain our focus on monetizing and understanding the Qualified Lead > Converted loan game. Its worth noting that although we did not close a huge volume of loans this month, we did have a lot more volume pending. On SoFi alone we have almost 300k in listed loans. So we\\'re getting people over to our partners in a better way. But obviously to do this we need to nail the process of getting them to click and having those loans attributed.\\n\\nThe other big improvement over last month was the focus and energy in the office. Everybody did a fantastic job this month, taking initiative, staying late when needed and getting things out on time and in a way that didnt create problems down the road. So I really appreciate that, and I believe its a result of us being aligned around the focus of the company and our shared goals. Like I said to Jacob at State of the Start Up, even though we didnt meet our objectives for this month, the ones I set for ourselves in our weekly update a couple of weeks back - I\\'m feeling very confident that with the same energy and focus we can get to $20,000 a month in revenue by March.\\n\\nThis month there will be a big emphasis on contractors, and we\\'re kicking that off with our trip to New Orleans this week. Thank you to everyone who put so much work into that. This new orleans trip will be about signing up customers but more importantly as we\\'ve seen -- understanding them. I\\'m looking forward to having conversations with all these roofing companies about how they see financing, what works and doesnt work, so that we can take it back and build a best in class product.\\n\\nI\\'m disappointing that all the efforts we made did not translate into meaningful revenue growth this month, but I\\'m happy that (1) we know why (2) the fundamental indicators that we care about like channel mix and growth are very strongly positive.\\n\\nHope you all have an excellent weekend. See you in a week!\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We got a lot done last week, thank you to everyone who helped push it all over the finish line. We're tracking pretty well on QL's which are just under 200 halfway through the month. Unfortunately we havent had many closed loans come through this week, but we're aiming to call everyone who was in the high intent [now-two weeks] bucket and clicked a loan in the last month this week to see if we can get some more people past the finish line there.\\n\\nWe shot two big arrows at our bottom of the funnel conversion problem this week -- the one offer page and the points offering. It will be interesting to track how those do down the funnel as the week progresses. Early signs are hard to decypher but I'm optimistic that at the very least we'll get a conclusive measurement of whether one offer is superior or inferior to multiple offers.\\n\\nWe have a lot of ongoing BD work that could require a lot of work if we pull through -- experian, kohler, lendingtree, aquafinance, upstart etc, as we try to get a more comprehensive credit platform out into the market.\\n\\nWe've had a lot of success with contractors this week, thanks especially to Will's great work getting us into the roofing expo. We also signed on several beta testers who we have calls lined up with next week and several totally unpaid new parters. We're at 9 contractors using our platform total, which is not bad. In an ideal world this will begin to convert loans, but in a more realistic world, we'll start to get signals on what we could be changing on our end in order to create a strong product offering, which is what this effort is really about.\\n\\nA bunch of exciting things happening next week moving the needle on contractors and other projects. On the product/eng side I remain somewhat concerned about the unreliability of heap. Being a data driven company and not having good data is the key to taking a meandering and unfruitful path so I want to be sure we pay attention to and fix that this week. I know NIkhil is planning on piloting some new visualization software that will hopefully bring more accuracy to our instrumentation.\\n\\nOther than that we're likely going to close on another 500k for our note tomorrow, which is great news. That brings us to 1.1m closed, we have another 400 or so committed that I'll be closing on incrementally over the course of the quarter.\\n\\nAnd last but not least we had the great pleasure of adding Stephanie and Stefano to our team this week. They both did a fantastic job getting up to speed this week. Thank you to you two for your great efforts and great job to everyone who led such a smooth and comprehensive on-boarding process.\\n\\nAs a final reminder -- our goals for this quarter:\\n\\n1. $20,000 of close loans in March\\n\\n2. 30 closed loans from marketplaces in march\\n\\n3. 20 closed loans from contractors in march\\n\\nLots of progress on all three fronts this week with the testing and contractor on-boarding. Looking forward to a great week ahead of us.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Shannon's done an excellent job laying the groundwork for our product vision so thank you for that. Nikhil, the beast, pumped out the offers page redesign this week, to be built next week, and launched the new loan flow wizard [shout out to the eng team for turning that and the ab test for the quiz around so quickly]. Its seemingly like we're at the very early stages of learning how to capture leads off the buildzoom flow which is useful and I am optimistic about. Based on my conversations with rebeccah and shannon two things are becoming increasingly clear to me:\\n\\n1) There is a very specific use case for a personal loan in a remodel. That use case is likely someone who has no home equity and is remodeling in a reactive manner [meaning something broke, natural disaster etc]\\n\\n2) People secure financing POST securing a contractor and bid. This has pretty significant implications for the method of integration we've been discussing with buildzoom. I want to find some way to test this hypothesis with them. [\\n\\nBrandon and Rebeccah did some great work as far as marketing is concerned -- Rebeccah nailed the first draft of our remodeling guide, while Brandon and I figure out how we want to invest in the various paid channels we have access to. The big learning this week was that we need to do a better job qualifying our top of the funnel leads off of google. We're relaunching the google engine with the lead qualification metric the eng team put in place next week, so excited to see that go forward. We also put in place our sales cycle so we've been actively calling people who input their phone numbers on the advice form. This has led to a bunch of learnings and one test -- to make it clear that our application form isnt a formal loan application -- this has had interesting affects on engagement [more people starting the form, less people completing it]. Also we're considering launching the Hearth brand which will be exciting and distracting but hopefully improve our ability to get backlinks and be known to consumers.\\n\\nAnthony V has done immense work in terms of mapping out future states and insurance this week, laying the groundwork for what expansion should look like once we get some key information from our board and can proceed with the licensing. I complained about the licensing process to our friend Ted Cruz, as well as Governor Doug Ducey this weekend, so our struggles are not going quietly. I also realized David Crane and I are on the board of USCS and he may be a useful contact for us as far as navigating the DBO -- I'm having dinner with him on Tuesday. I also got the chance to hear some remarks by Brian Singerman from Founders Fund and Patrick Collison from Stripe on building technology in a regulated industry which was fascinating. I caught Patrick after their talk and he said they hired a GC as employee 8 at Stripe and that they had a lot of competitors cutting corners too. They mentioned that they stayed in lightly regulated areas and over time won on product and ease of integration -- something I hope serves us as we realize this marketplace strategy over the course of the coming year. Also Shannon I may have a strong in for Hartford and Zurich through a guy I met here that runs a bespoke insurance producer out of Ohio.\\n\\nOn the eng side we had a lot of wins, I'm very partial to us figuring out how to work with blockscore. I think that could be a massive lever to drive more leads through our flow over time -- pretty excited about that. Congratulations to Scott Morris on a successful first week and pushing code within his first two days here. Big week for us on the eng recruiting side as Jacob simon hit 5/5's across the board and is now in the hands of our wise advisors who are speaking to him in the coming days. We'll know more next week as thats certainly going to be top of mind for us. This is also the last week we have until John Alhadi joins us first week of July [he joins on the 5th].\\n\\nOn the business side we signed a deal with Freedom Financial for 2% of loans originated on our platform on Friday, bringing the total amount of lenders we're working with to 6 [which is actually higher than our BD goal originally, which was 5]. Freedom and Avant together will make us a more compelling offering to marketplaces in that we'll be able to service low-fico users. Speaking of marketplaces, we scheduled a call with Porch this week, as well as sent a proposal to Houzz via their chairman, Oren Zeev and finally I got the introduction to Mark Stein who is a senior person at IAC, Joe is also having a meeting with Joey Levine, their CEO in New York next week so we're hitting them from a couple of angles.\\n\\nSo lots of good momentum this week going into the end of the quarter. Lots of work to do this coming week, in particular launching a couple of key features, turning paid back on and exploring bing [higher credit score people use bing], following up on these key business opportunities and nailing our first bi-weekly sync with Buildzoom. Probably lots I missed here as well but these are the things that stuck out.\\n\\nHere are the big goals for next week -- feel free to add any that I'm missing, and I'm sure more will come out this week. Also Gavin, my intern, will be starting this week with the goal of doing a lanscape analysis for other home IQ services that might touch on some of the themes we have in mind longer term.\\n\\nJoe/Drew Docs Ready\\n\\nDesigner On-Site schedule\\n\\nBoger On-Site\\n\\nProduct Vision Inputs\\n\\nOffers view launch\\n\\nInsurance Roadmap Begins\\n\\nProduct Theme\\n\\nMarket Map for Home IQ Products\\n\\nExperian [Contracts Review]\\n\\nHomepage Launch\\n\\nAbout Page Launch\\n\\nPublish Guide\\n\\nLoans Page Redo\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

The biggest thing for us next week is a successful launch of the Quiz V2, on Tuesday or Wednesday. I'm optimistic as well about a lot of the great work Marketing is doing to personalize drip campaigns. I'm sorry I didnt get the chance to rope Bhaskar in last week, I'm shooting for this week to get his notes on what we should be focused on in terms of the funnel.\\n\\nAt a high level, getting a solid commitment over the course of the next couple of quarters from Buildzoom is going to make strategizing much easier. That paired with the IAC introduction and the Porch introduction puts us about where I want us to be in terms of the marketplace strategy.\\n\\nThe data we've been able to put together in terms of datatrace, house canary and potentially SNL [local banking data] will be very useful. Pair that with the wonderful work Shannon is doing on the customer interview side is going give us a really powerful foundation on which we can ideate w/r to the product vision.\\n\\nOur funnel is performing really well actually, that being said we can do better. I think with a 30% click through rate, its time we start focusing more attention [once we complete the quiz v2] on the rest of the funnel. If we can convert even 5% of buildzoom's customers off the contractor page we can hit 1m ARR by the end of the year. So far that number is far lower but we have plenty of levers to pull to increase it. We had about 7 people complete the flow last week, which is small time but a massive improvement over where we started (with 5 click through and bounced, 3 months ago]. I think its really important we focus on slope here and continue to drive energy into optimizing this funnel.\\n\\nI'm pretty happy with the progress we're making, I continue to believe that the most existential risk to the company is keeping a solid and productive culture, avoiding political dynamics and being able to iterate quickly. The key to this is having a mentality of finding problems and then working on solutions vs finding problems and then panicking or becoming demoralized. We are sitting on a 300b market opportunity, with 30 months of run way and a world class group of advisors/board members not to mention one of the best, if not the best, seed teams I've come across. We have made a tremendous amount of progress over the last 8.3 months and I'm very excited about where we could be a couple of months from now. This is the opportunity of a lifetime in many ways, and we should not lose track of that.\\n\\nNote that I'll be out Friday and Monday, Tuesday of next week. I'm taking some time off to see my family in Europe but will be online and available.\\n\\nAlso before I wrap up this note I'm happy to settle the conversation about my interns this summer. I'm going to have two interns -- Gavin Coulson [this is Holly's little brother] and Shivham Agarwal. Gavin just graduated from Choate and is going to uPenn next year as a freshman, he is a very sharp kid and I know that you'll actually all enjoy working with him. I've been mentoring him since he was 13 and am excited to show him the insides of a business. Shivham is a rising senior in high school and very very much ahead of the curve. He interned at sofi last year helping them create a mortgage product and market it to investors. He was recommended to me by Paul Fieldings at SoFi. As you all know I take mentorship very seriously and am proud to be able to offer these two -- who will be very successful in their own right -- a competitive advantage by virtue of this opportunity. Both will be here for a month [consecutively] and both will be unpaid internships.\\n\\nSee you all bright and early tomorrow!\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nHere are the goals as I see them for the coming week:\\n\\nUTM Attribution for the QuizQuiz v2 LaunchDrip Campaign StrategyPaid Search LaunchCustomer Interviews CTA’s for BZ -- try changing text?

We\\'re trailing our goals just a bit this month, but nonetheless crossed 10k in under 7 days I believe so we\\'re continuing the growth. That being said with self serve not working, we\\'re looking at really bad unit economics on the sales we are making, so there is a lot of work to do there to bring this back again. We\\'ve got to do something thinking around whether it makes sense to just revert to the exact old pricing or what exactly is going on [maybe its the coupon code?]. In any case, positive momentum, but we\\'ve got to drive really hard over the next couple of weeks if we want to approach 60k, right now our pace will have us at 40k, which is 33% growth but not what any of us are optimizing for [+ the unit economics will be horrible on that revenue].\\n\\nGreat job to Anthony vitarelli on bringing lightstream into the mix, thank you to everyone who helped on that including Jakub who I know got that up and running a couple of weeks ago. Its looking like its having a really strong affect on click through and frankly seems like their offers are extremely reasonable/attractive across the board which I think will reflect well across all of the key metrics we\\'re tracking.\\n\\nExcited to get some of this gamification work out this week, as we figure out how to drive really good outcomes for our contractors. Amidst the whole facebook scandal and some of the back and forth between Zuck and Tim Cook, someone mentioned an old amazon parable. It went something like \"there are companies that focus on charging their consumers as much as possible, and there are companies that focus on charging their consumers as little as possible\" -- being the difference between Amazon/Facebook and Apple. It got me thinking a bit about the way we\\'re approaching everything, and I think its important we dont lose sight of the bigger picture [I\\'m the first to admit that I definitely did in that conversation about refunds, on which I\\'ve come essentially full circle].\\n\\nIn any case, we\\'re not facing lots of growth challenges, and have to stay disciplined but ambitious across all the key projects we\\'re undertaking. The good side is that these are totally new and interesting challenges, the bad side is that they\\'re going to be tough! But we\\'ll get through them, it might just take us a little more time than we hope. We should nonetheless drive forward and try to make the timeline we want versus the start up gods want.\\n\\nGodspeed everyone! Have a fantastic weekend, looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

       "  \"Weekly Note\\n\\nSunday, November 5, 2017 9:19:01 AM GMT-08:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nHi everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nFirst things first, last week I made a point of bringing up our Buildzoom performance and how it was a core priority for us to improve. This week we've seen over 100% growth in the qualified leads volume coming from buildzoom. 3 months ago we couldnt eek out 1 qualified lead from buildzoom, today we're pulling just under 20 a week. This just goes to show how persistence, focus and discpline can really make a huge difference with these things. 20 qualified. We've had just around $500,000 qualified leads on buildzoom this week, which means there is some intent there that we're beginning to capture. We still need to fix the last step across channels, but I think this brings to fore the importance of continuing to focus on buildzoom. I believe we can get to at least 100 qualified leads on biuldzoom a week with the current coverage, and not including the california and texas coverage. I think we can get the click through on our landing page up near what we see on paid channels. Right now the click through is hovering under 10%, if we can get it to 40 or 50%, which is what we're seeing on other channels, then we'll have around 10 loans from buildzoom a week at a 10% conversion rate from offer to funded.\\n\\nI know a lot of people have been wondering -- why is buildzoom so important, why is paintzen so important -- and the answer is simple: not because of their latent intent, but because of what they enable in terms of future marketplace integrations. Having these two under our belt, and being able to show growth and traction on top of them is a key piece of ultimately figuring out how to unlock latent intent on existing marketplaces -- which represent in and of themselves billions of dollars of transaction volume and fixed unit economics. The key here is to crack digital distribution for financial services companies looking to grow market share in the home improvement space. But this is something that we're going to have to fight for and is going to take time to do. The ideal world here is one in which we're able to funnel traffic off of existing marketplaces, motentize that traffic and loop the customers into a broader platform that helps them make financial decisions around their house. If we're able to do this, we've got a very serious business in this channel, and a unique competitive advantage.\\n\\nIn other news, a special shout out goes to Will for closing 2 contractors for our beta. This is going to be a really important piece for us. That plus the opportunity to partner with Feldco [we sent them a contract earlier in the week] is going to give us a really good wedge into that market. We spoke to the folks at Prosper about helping power their home improvement product but in reality the call ended up being about them surveying us for information. In addition to the 2 contractors and feldco, we have outstanding leads with Pella, Kohler, The roofing associations of Washington and Florida. Lots of really strong advancement here that puts us in a strong position with respect to building out this channel.\\n\\nReally pleased to see SEO starting to kick in more, with roughly 10 qualified leads this week. SEO is the slow and steady tide that will continue to grow as Brandon runs the process in the background. I expect that if you're using google to find roof financing by the end of the year, you're not going to be able to miss us. Micro-vertical focus is key. And I think we've done a strong job there.\\n\\nThe month is kicking off to a strong start with 3 pending lendkey loans, a funded $35,000 lending club loan and some others which we may not yet know about. Not only that we kicked the ball into Thumbtack's court for a partnership pilot via e-mail and we'll likely hear feedback about the e-mails we sent them sometime this week. In addition we have a pilot in process with Roofr [thanks Will for opening that door] that will kick of sometime in the coming weeks. On the less awesome front, I havent really heard back from \\n\\npro.com but the CEO there isnt very quick on e-mail. I have some friends back channeling to figure out whats going on.\\n\\nPart of why I'm raising this note now is to keep us focused on sewing these seeds for future growth and not slaves to month over month metric. This is a business that is going to take time and grit to build but the pay off is going to be enormous. As you know I'm on the east coast this week lining up investors for this note, but I'll be on line and available if you need me. I'm most excited about nailing this recommendations flow push this week.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

I saw some fantastic work from everyone this week. I have to say, being gone and coming back has allowed me the distance to appreciate how brilliant our team is. I left Austin feeling extremely grateful to work with everyone [there and in SF]. We have such an incredible opportunity in front of us, and I think we're going about problem solving in the right way. This brings us nicely into the topic that I wanted to cover this week -- our second value -- truth.\\n\\nThe reason I wanted truth to be a value at Shogun is because in companies what you tend to see as things scale is a culture of obfuscating problems. Problems are the most critical input to our work, we need to have a clear map of what issues there are to be resolved before we can come up with solutions to them. That is why data is such an important part of our company -- we're constantly searching for the truth of the situation. The ability to see things as they are and not let ego/professional dynamics etc is, in my opinion, a necessary input to success as without it problems sneak up on you and catch you off guard. This is why when you see things that need improvement across the company, its important that these things be flagged quickly so that we can resolve them appropriately. Holding truth as a value represents our commitment to being straightforward about identifying problems early on. In order to do that though, we need to have a collective understanding and appreciation for the fact that problems can and will be solved. The worst thing we can do once we've identified the problem is to shrug our shoulders. In my time at this company I have not encountered one single problem that we have not been able to breakdown and solve. Some problems are harder than others, but the only thing that is stressful about solving problems is when one runs out of ideas -- something that we also havent come across yet. The reason I say this and want to put it in writing is because I want to be absolutely clear with everyone -- especially those of you who are just joining the company -- please raise any issues or deficiencies you identify with those around you and be proactive about offering solutions, this is the key to continuous\\xa0 improvement. These dont need to be big issues, they can be small ones like bugs you find, ideas for improvement in the company's processes or culture or really anything you can think of.This company is all about slope and continuous improvement, it has been since the beginning. None\\xa0 of us started here knowing a single thing about home improvement loans OR building technology companies, we learned it through trial and error, and it is the same process of quick iteration and honest reflection that is going to take this company far. A precondition to that is having as close as to a clear vision of reality as possible. This isnt easy, especially as the organization grows, but it is a key part of the culture we'd like to build and a culture we're going to need in order to win!\\n\\nWe're gearing up for a monstrous end to the quarter, I'm very excited about what comes next as we think through our plans and goals for Q2.\\n\\nOnwards and upwards everyone!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

We are at 70 QL's a week for the week so far, which is strong and what I expect to be the new baseline going forward as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. Buildzoom is being slow - we're at 12 where I believe we could easily get to 20 - and Roofr is down. We're working on some paintzen improvements, and expect to get some Feldco and Realtor leads this month which could get us to an average of around 100. The biggest focus for me this coming week will be the new offers page test. I hope that we can run two offers page tests this month to see how they affect ultimate conversion on the lender side. A key part of getting this done will be understanding how what we do on our\\xa0 offers page [or any other part of our funnel] affects conversion on the lender side. Instrumenting our product such that we can understand the conversion rate on the lender side seems like such an obvious thing to try to optimize the funnel, that I'm kicking myself for not having thought of it earlier. This is a project I'd like to get out of the way [the instrumentation part] early this week so that we can start to plan for the test. I know that this may seem to come at the expense of development and energy around product development and unification on other fronts, but its important to note that we're one sweet step away from a lot more revenue as a business. And I think that a solid bedrock of led generation revenue + a well articulated and initially developed broader product are the preconditions to keeping this business alive past 2018. I know that the product vision and platform are important and represent the opportunity of a higher global maxima for the business, but nonetheless this last step of the funnel is the single most important thing on my mind and has been on my mind. We're also far from our 100 loan goal for the quarter, at just under 20 loans so far. We have plenty pending, but nonetheless we closed 96000 of loans last month, which is the highest for us but still is far under what I expect we should do and whats possible with 6,000,000 in qualified leads a month. My main goal for this month is to get us to 8,500,000 qualified that we have achieved 100,000,000 in annualized leads to lenders, I think that will be a great indicator of value to future channel partners, investors and lenders.\\n\\nHere are the goals:\\n\\n•500 Qualified Leads a month in December: I'm somewhat worried about getting here because of christmas. I think if we can hit 125 leads in one week, I would consider this goal met as this will be a month with many confounding variables.\\n\\nClose 100 Loans: This one will be the most difficult to hit at this rate, unless we get very lucky and crack the last step test on our first try.\\n\\n•Sell a credit card lead: Done\\n\\n500 Qualified Leads a month in December: I'm somewhat worried about getting here because of christmas.

We’re going to need to pick up the pace a bit in terms of revenue to accomplish our goals, but I have full faith that we’ll come through at the end of the month with a big win. A lot of projects came through on multiple fronts this week. The one I’m personally most excited about is gamification, which launched to our contractors mid/late week as part of app version 1.6. Good job getting that one out, excited to see what it yields. I spoke to one of our newer contractors this weekend and he was very excited at getting certified and putting it on his website. Curious to study the results this coming week. I had a busy week on a couple of different fronts -- I spent a good amount of time in Florida early in the week with two of our pilot contractors through GAF. It definitely caused me some pause as the contractors I was talking to collectively did about $40m in roofing a year, and are both looking to finance up to half of their volume. That means that one or two of these companies could ostensibly double our revenue from loans versus what we have now. I’m glad that we’re focusing on newer contractors, but I thought it was an interesting datapoint worth sharing. I sat in a room with 10 sales reps at Arry’s roofing and one of them volunteered to go through the full application himself to show everyone how it works. Besides a slew of aesthetic bugs that we are addressing, he was able to get qualified for up to 100k and get a hard approval shortly thereafter for 30k which was how much he was looking for. It was a pretty cool experience to watch, although I was ultra sensitive to all the product debt in the flow, the sales reps thought it worked like magic and it seemed to click for them. It turned out a lot of them had not received our seats drip [as part of a very focused issue we’re having with their servers and emails], but this emphasized to me the importance of showing people the video where they can better understand what the actual flow looks like. I spent the next day in South Carolina with Brandon Perry, the CEO & Founder of AMS. I visited their offices and spent a lot of time talking to him about the market and opportunity. My big take away here is that we should consider substituting the insurance key result for a credit card key result. It seems that thats a huge source of business for him and the contractors love being able to offer 0% products, especially ones that dont imply any fees for them [outside of processing fees if we’re being fair]. He mentioned that a lot of ones ability to monetize that product comes down to the specific deal with the generator -- he said that we should focus on going directly to an issuer [capital one, chase etc] and make a deal that way as those are the highest margin. He makes almost as much money from selling these credit cards as he does from personal loans. So my sense is this might actually be the smarter thing to focus on from a product integration/bd perspective in the immediate term. Let me know if you disagree. We are still moving insurance forward, Meredith introduced me to some folks who are getting back to us on a lighter lead gen to smb deal which could allow us to prove this insurance model out without hiring an agent in the immediate term. There are a couple final tires to kick there, and his team is reviewing our proposed legal documents for the acquisition, that should move along materially this coming week. I spent the rest of the week in Austin catching up on the latest there. Pretty amazing to see how its grown, and really fantastic to see and catch up with the newest members of our team there too. Its increasingly looking like we’re going to eclipse the space we had there, so we spent some time visiting new office space. We put out a letter of intent on a much larger space that we think has the potential to accommodate our growth over the next year and change especially if we focus on outbound. To that end, we’re having Steve work on a new outbound script that we should be getting next week, we also hired a new rep to join the team there that we’re all excited about and who has worked closely with a lot of our existing team in the past. In other news, we had a kick off call with homeadvisor -- thank you to those of you who grinded out the deliverables there, and congrats to kevin for the quick turn around. There are a couple of points of integration that should go live in the coming weeks and then we’re also going into their newsletter that goes out to all of their contractors. I was actually pretty surprised at the scale of their operation -- one of the campaigns we’re being integrated in is their on-boarding drip that apparently goes out to 11,000 contractors a month which is pretty wild if you think about it. Curious to see what the conversion rates are there, either way I’m confident this will be good for our brand. Finally, I have some difficult news to share with everyone. After a lot of contemplation and planning as well as extended discussions, we have decided to shut down our customer success operation in San Francisco. This means we will be losing two extremely valuable and formative members of our team at the end of this week -- Stephanie and Maira. This has been probably the most difficult decision we’ve had to come to as a company, but being true to our interests as well as our commitment to crafting authentic paths for growth for each member of our team, we felt strongly that we needed to have a centralized team from which to grow in Austin. Both Maira and Stephanie have decided to pursue other opportunities in San Francisco versus moving to Austin which we accept and respect although with a heavy heart! They have our full support in their next endeavors and the company has arranged for their transition to be as smooth as possible in all respects. There are a lot of valuable lessons for us to be learned as an organization here, that being said this likely not the time to explore them. Right now I just want to say thank you to both of them for their excellent work and extremely formative contribution to our company. I genuinely could not imagine a better team to have worked with through the early period of customer success, and am so grateful to both of them for their incredible commitment to the development of this company as well as their commitment to our taking care of our hard earned customers. Please take a moment to thank them for everything they’ve done and give them a squeeze as this will be their last week full time at Shogun, although of course they will be around in the future. See you all tomorrow!Anthony'),\n",

The engineering team spearheaded our progress there with their big push towards our set up revamp A.K.A \"Kitchen Sink\". It looks like we can expect that to come through sometime this coming week, lets be sure that everyone who touches the customer knows exactly what the customer experience is going to be -- especially on sales where you\\'re no longer going to be able to tell people that they can use the product the moment they pay for it. This was really a team effort, but the engineering team did a particularly good job this last week especially given that more than half of the team was out -- Zak spent a bunch of time coding as did Stephan and the interns. Thanks for pushing that through, everyone.\\n\\nI want to touch on a couple of topics today -- the first one is this new \"path to 10\" idea. For those of you who might not know what that means -- its the name we gave to our new initiative around orienting all of our customers to achieve 10 completes within the first 2 months of their subscription with Hearth. Basically we sat down and asked ourselves a couple of questions. At a high level our goal is to increase engagement, where our main bottom of the funnel metric is number of accounts with one or more funded loans. If you zoom out and look at the data, its extremely clear that the more completes someone has the more funded loans they have (see below), and strictly speaking the more likely they are to have at least 1 funded loan.\\n\\nThe graph above shows average funded loan volume on the Y axis and number of completes (in buckets) on the X axis. So if you\\'ve done between 1-3 completes, on average you\\'ve funded 2.2k of loans and so on and so forth. Another analysis shows that if you\\'ve done 10 completes then (I\\'m recalling from memory but I\\'m fairly certain) your likelihood of having done at least 1 loan is over 85%.\\n\\nThe challenge of course is that if you dont fund a loan in your first 9 attempts, you\\'re going to be hard pressed to try a tenth time! But what the graph above clearly shows is that \\n\\nFor the team in sales (that have made it this far in my email) its like the upfront contract in the sales script. It feels uncomfortable to use if you\\'re not familiar with it, and if you try it 10 times and it doesnt work, you\\'re unlikely to try it again -- but it does work. So the key is really to get the contractors we have to understand that getting into the habit of offering financing every time will return positively to their business (in a fairly substantial way). In order to do this we\\'re trying to kick them off with the goal of running 10 homeowners through their application, knowing well that the vast majority (>85%) will fund at least 1 loan once they\\'ve completed this on-boarding step. And hopefully in the mean time we can equip them to understand why anyone who was rejected or didnt fund the loan ended up going in that direction. The brilliance of the product is that it really only needs to work once for its value to be established in a decisive manner, but the challenge is that that experience is stochastic.\\n\\nBefore we used to kick our customers off but we did not give them a clear path to success. This initiative was inspired a body of psychological studies about voter turn out, they show that if you give voters a date time and map to get from where they are to the voting station, they are a lot more likely to turn out and vote. The insight that was derived from this study was that if you map out someones intention in concrete tactics, they are much more likely to act against that intention. Obviously people who buy our product want to use financing, but how exactly to do that successfully has been a mystery to our user base until now. The idea with path to 10 is that we\\'re queuing users to pursue a concrete tactical path that we know will lead them to value. Hopefully it will also get them to understand that financing is a habit that yields fruit from repetition versus a one-off silver bullet.\\n\\nThe CS team has already started socializing this notion of path to 10 with customers but the results are still too early. The product team is developing product level trackers as well as corresponding nudges (push notifications etc) along with marketing that will show people how far along they are on the path to 10. We just launched an email campaign that shows you \"you are X% to your goal of 10 completes\" and it sends every 3 days to remind people to use it regularly.\\n\\nUltimately this is a test, but I\\'m confident that if we can get it right and streamline expectations across onboarding sales and product usage, we can get a much higher percent of our customer base to succeed.\\n\\nLooking forward to seeing this play out over the next couple of weeks! Let me know if you have any additional thoughts or questions.\\n\\nIn the mean time hope everyone is enjoying their sunday!\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We made a lot of progress on a number of fronts. First and foremost, I\\'d like to welcome Travis officially. Travis, we\\'re extremely excited to have you and very optimistic about what you\\'ll be able to accomplish while you\\'re here.\\n\\nNext, as I mentioned in my e-mail earlier this week, very excited and happy about having crossed 500k in income this month. This is a huge milestone for us, and although its always been on the radar as part of the plan, crossing the threshold is an entirely new and exciting place to be.\\n\\nThere is so much going on in the company, in any given week that I\\'m always likely to miss some things, but from my perspective this week was highlighted by a couple of notable initiatives.\\n\\nOn the personnel side, in addition to bringing on travis, we\\'ve also successfully hired a new Head of Revenue Ops, Ed Bailey, who is joining us on July 1st. I\\xa0 met Ed through Ben Rubenstein who many of you know from Yodle. I think Ben will bring a lot of experience to our operations in a way that will have a large impact on a day to day basis for anyone touching the customers. Whats more, Aaron Jones is \"officially\" joining Shogun starting tomorrow. As many of you know, Aaron has been helping us navigate the outbound lead lists as a contractor, and we\\'re grateful to him for his time and talent. The early signs from the lists he scraped are extremely promising. Moreover, John Marini, who has also been helping us in a contractor capacity, has his official kick off as a full time member of our team this coming Monday. Lots is changing as we scale up the experience we have on our team to help guide us to the next 10x growth period. Speaking of growth, Brandon has been able to tame the facebook dragon and our inbound MQLs are at their lowest rate in recent history which means inbound and recycled teams will be welcomed by a huge influx of leads this coming monday to kick off what we all expect to be our best month ever by far.\\n\\nOn the product and customer success side, we\\'ve launched a new initiative to have our team reach out to homeowners to see if they need any help in navigating the application process. We suspect that there is a lot of confusion in how to go about getting a loan online that we can help clarify in such a way that increases the amount of loans we issue. Whats more, product released a new version of our core application funnel that helps guide people away from loan amounts that we know will result in them getting rejected (we had a big problem where people with 25k of income were applying for 60k which never results in an approval, so now the app tells them to apply for less and recommends an amount that they will qualify for based on our data). Although the numbers are very small, the complete rate is a lot higher for the new flow, as is the approval rate which means more people are finding successful outcomes on our product. It is too early to see what effect this will have on our funded loans, but we are watching it carefully and regularly. Another exciting test that product launched this week was our 0% credit card test, which went into the hands of 11 (I may be slightly off on this number) contractors. As you all know, this has a lot of potential to massively increase the value of activity coming from the contractor. Eager to watch that play out.\\n\\nOn my side, I\\'ve been very focused on fund raising and talking to investors. Its clear that we have a very strong business, especially given that its only been just over 2.5 years since we started it. Its been an interesting process and I\\'ve learned a lot even about the business as the investors have asked me questions which have introduced new frameworks for measuring our success. All in all, it is going well, my hope is that it is concluded by the end of this coming month. The additional capital will give us a lot of freedom to expand and experiment but I\\'m attempting to be hyper disciplined about the terms of the investment as we have a very strong business that is quite cash efficient and frankly we dont really need to raise any money. I will keep you all in the loop on how this develops over time.\\n\\nLooking forward to pushing everything forward this coming week. Congratulations everyone!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

       "  \"Weekly Update 1.27.19\\n\\nSunday, January 27, 2019 6:15:15 PM GMT-08:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nGreetings folks,\\xa0\\n\\nWishing you all a restful weekend fresh off our best week of sales \\n\\nFirst I have some non-ideal news, which is that after extensive discussions with the team, the board and my family, I have decided to return to Europe to help manage the situation with my family for up to one month starting this coming Tuesday. For the past month I have tried to ride two horses at once by running the company full time while managing the team focused on my family situation from 4am until I got into work and again after work. For the first time in my life, despite how committed I am to both the company and to defending my dad, I realized I could not do both simultaneously well or for an extended period of time. I feel there are a concrete set of initiatives I need to wrap up with respect to my family situation before I can return to physical presence in the office and that those things can be completed in a months time as a maximum. It is not an ideal outcome, but its a less than ideal situation more broadly and it calls for meaningful sacrifice. Had this happened one year ago, it would have been a disaster for the company, but I have never been more confident in our team and our ability to execute against a concrete and well defined plan. I spent this week reviewing the objectives, key results and composite projects for every department, and I'm truly impressed with the leadership, organization and dedication that I saw across the board. My physical and temporary departure is actually a testament to the strength of the company, and the strength of the team. I am really deeply grateful to all of you for putting in your best work day after day and ensuring that through this difficult situation Shogun is able to prosper. Its truly amazing, and its a blessing. I have coordinated with the department heads, Natalie and Kevin to come up with an operational structure that will allow me to be available for daily decisions as well as all of our weekly department and team meetings, just digitally. I have to say that I really hate that this is happening, and I regret any consequences of it, I try to demonstrate consistency and set an example for commitment to the company, so it is not an easy decision to come to -- I'm just in an exceptional circumstance that I could have never envisioned. I reflected on how to truthfully convey this decision to the company over the weekend in a way that would paint an accurate picture of whats going through my head and how I think about it. And it occurred to me that the best way might be to answer a simple and familiar question. Every person here has been asked a simple question upon interviewing at Shogun -- what are you looking for from your next professional opportunity [i.e what can Shogun give YOU]. Its an important part of the mutual benefit equation. I have asked that question to everyone and it occurred to me this weekend that I had never answered the question, I thought that by trying to get at that it might be a useful assurance of my commitment and my mindset, because Shogun is truly one of the most important things in my life.\\n\\nFor me, Shogun is my entire life's work and I plan for it to continue to be for a long, long time. Its a vehicle to manifest my values and desired impact. The highest ideal for Shogun is and has always been for it to be a truly transformative company. The first is that those that joined the company were enriched not only financially by their participation but more importantly that it provided opportunity for deep personal development and career advancement. Why? Because in my view leadership is about helping others achieve their goals. I dont believe that its possible to get people to do things that they dont want to do, I dont believe its possible to get a customer to buy a product they dont want, I think people act as a means of satisfying their own desires [this is not a bad thing, its just a predictive model for behavior]. Since my background and family is now a matter of public knowledge, I'll address it directly here because it is a big part of who I am and why I started this business. My parents both were born into very difficult situations in the world, my mom grew up in civil war torn Lebanon and never got a college degree, and my dad was born in Porto Velho, a very remote town in northern Brazil. My parents worked hard, sacrificed a lot and were able to achieve some remarkable things. They fought for everything they got. It was difficult for them to figure out how to raise kids in a context vastly different from their own. When I was a kid, I spent a lot of time in Brazil, Lebanon and other poverty stricken parts of the world, I learned quickly that the world I was living in was very different from that of others. It was a difficult concept to reconcile, there are a lot of different ways of doing so. Some people assume that they are given the privilege of financial independence, good schooling etc because they are special and deserve it, some feel that they dont deserve it become apologists for random distribution. I oscillated between both to be frank in my youth, but when I started reading more I came to a very simple conclusion: whether one is deserving or undeserving of their circumstance is a function of what one does with it -- its actually in your control. You dont have to be anything anyone else assumes you to be, its really up to you to figure out what you do, how you behave\\xa0 and what impact you have. From then on I've been resolved to deliver the maximum possible contribution to people's lives in all areas of my life -- whether they be friends or co-workers, I simply decided that I wanted to do what I could to help people achieve their goals and grow, thats how I build meaning. The Shogun Logo is a broken circle which is a symbol I came up with [thats right Nikhil \\n\\nI wanted to make sure everyone knew this, its important to me that you not only understand why the company exists but also that my commitment to you and to making this company a vehicle for your dreams and ambitions remains rock solid.\\n\\nIn the mean time, I want you to know that the understanding, support and effort I've seen over the last two months has been really deeply meaningful and seriously appreciated.\\n\\nGodspeed everyone,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

We had our best week ever coming in at 27k! This was due primarily to the excellent work in Austin, thank you to everyone there for grinding it out this week. The numbers are looking good, especially on outbound, I'm feeling confident that that can be a channel for growth for us.\\n\\nSpeaking of channels we had a big week last week, and an even bigger week coming up this week. This week we launch our first SRS campaign, find out what next steps are on HomeAdvisor and hear back from the folks at GAF about their conclusions. We saw some good signal with the Madsky closes, where I think we had just under 10 new paying customers from them. Its also looking like our new agency is doing a great job and finding some interesting new opportunities on Facebook. Our latest landing page test increased our account creations by about 60% which is amazing, because you essentially get cost per lead down by a proportionate number which means we'll be able to drive more warm leads to our fantastic sales team. I'm very proud of the work everyones doing here. What I was most proud of this week, was learning that on average our contractors are making $9.80 for every dollar they spend on Hearth, including the hundreds of contractors that have never used the product [in the average of course]. This is huge to me, it suggests that what we're building is really helping small businesses across the country grow -- truly amazing thing that we've built.\\n\\nLots of other progress -- this was an especially big week for Zak who closed our newest member of the engineering team while crushing tasks and getting the app out on time. Very impressed with your leadership here, Zak. We really appreciate it and it sets the bar. We're also on track for over 50% increase in funded loans, although we're not seeing a proportionate growth in our revenue from loans as our loan sizes are going down. I think there is good and bad to this. We're doing a lot more on the product side too that I'm very excited about including the know-before-you-go function. There is some great proactive work being done there, one of the things I'm most looking forward to next week is a strategy session between Saya, David and Nikhil on redesigning our entire product in a world where we're optimizing for the first complete. This is going to be a first principles session that I am optimistic will yield meaningful fruit. Revisiting our assumptions is going to be so critical to improving our company, as exemplified by this new landing page result.\\n\\nShort and sweet update this week as I'm at a conference in Colorado. Excited to see you all next week for a make or break week.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

There are still a lot of issues we need to fix -- we're not out of the woods with the bottom of the funnel piece yet, and a lot of our closed loans arent coming from our partnerships which means there is still lots of work to do there. I'm not yet sure if thats an intent issue or if its a quantity issue [i.e if we close 3 out of 100 QL's on average, we'd need at least 33 QL's to close one loan per channel]. That being said, we're attracting capital to the business, closing more customers, creating new partnerships and getting a lot of positive feedback on the platform and contractor piece which I'm excited to continue to explore next year. I think that contractors are a particularly attractive channel because we will have a lot of control of the funnel, no channel dependency, and potentially negative customer acquisition costs. Its an important time for us because we have very concrete products out in the market, but at the same time we need to stay flexible and adapt to opportunity. For example, the Kohler deal could mean 30 million in closed loans for us, but it would also require us to build a new product from scratch and figure out how to integrate with a merchant discounted loan [which we have yet to do]. I think the DIY piece is one that we didnt focus on at all in 2017 but could be key in 2018. Our first month closing over $1000 of revenue half way through the month is a great sign and hard fought victory, but it still sets us far from where we want to be. Next year is going to be an intense year. I want to grow our business at least 100 fold, meaning we are going to be making over $1 million dollars a year. This is going to take grit, risk and ingenuity from us. I think marketplace expansion alone wont get us there. We need to creatively drive more direct to consumer traffic -- focus on particular segments of the market where we are solving a real problem [i.e areas where banks dont lend against equity], create massive new channels [contractors], and expand our product offering [include secured, merchant discounting]. The road 100x from 100x will be based on us being creative about how we reengage customers. Do we focus on people who obsessively and regularly remodel their homes or do we expand out to all homeowners to provide them with an intelligence platform that helps them manage their asset? These are all questions we dont have the answers to but those answers will come through experimentation. This has been a long and hard fought year, but I have never been more optimistic about our prospects or proud to work with you all. As a company, we've grown strong, smart and resilient over the past year. We've been through a lot, and we have shown our resolve. That is the key to winning this game. As long as we are pointed in the right direction [home improvement finance] and continue to attract capital to the business, with this mentality we'll get there. Its just going to take time. Next year I expect us to graduate from being a seed company to finding strong product market fit and repeatable revenue. This first year and 3 months have been about learning, and obviously we will continue to learn, but next year we will put our lessons into action. Turn our insights into revenue. Build Hearth into a household name and burgeoning player in the real estate tech / fin tech space.\\n\\nSo everyone get some rest. Next year is going to be a hell of a ride, this year was just the very beginning.\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

On year ago we kicked off 2018 with the ambitious [then] goal of 20k a month by March 2018. We never thought in a million years that we\\'d be here now. I\\'m so proud of this team, and amazed at all the hard work and dedication that got us here. Its really incredible, something very special is happening. I\\'ll take a moment to talk about what how I think we got here and how that\\'ll inform our strategy going forward.\\n\\nMany of you have heard me say on multiple occasions that the key to in my opinion to success at a start up [or really in any endeavor] is to \\n\\nOur big \"problem\" right now is engagement, and we\\'re fighting tooth and nail to solve it. I\\'m extremely optimistic about the ability to find a solution. Here are three new developments that I think, in particular, are promising. The first is around customer centricity. We have meaningfully changed our culture to be one that is actively listening to our customers -- recently product started doing weekly calls with customer success, engineering started regularly listening and annotating to calls from our customers, we\\'ve implemented more rigorous systems to identify and resolve customer issues on the customer success side. The closer we are to the customer, the closer we are to figuring out why things stand where they do, and what limits people. The unique thing about our business is that our customers desperately want us to work for them, and its our job to figure this out. The second development is the new test that product and engineering launched to a set of beta customers that allows for a much simpler user experience. Gone are the days of \"before, during, after\" [yes, yes, I know what you\\'re thinking]. By staying close to our customers and iterating through our core dashboard experience with them, I\\'m confident we\\'ll get to a much more accessible tool. The third development that I found very interesting belies a strategic truth that I think is very critical -- \"always be prepared to revisit your assumptions\". We ran a bunch of tests on AMS\\'s web properties, our view when we bought the company was that we could use our sleek design and iterative process to improve the revenue they were generating from web traffic. As such, we introduced some tests that redirected a subset of their customers to our website. Guess what we discovered -- their funnel -- which we all thought was underinvested in -- turns out to monetize traffic \\n\\nChanging gears entirely -- this week we had two significant departures from our team. Jacob and David. Both Jacob and David were early members of the Shogun team, joining in 2017. When Jacob joined Shogun, I customarily asked him what he wanted from the experience. He told me something very simple -- he wanted to gain hands on experience growing a company so that he could one day go and start his own. I told him he\\'d get that at Shogun and that despite being on the engineering team, he\\'d get the opportunity to work across functions. Jacob was a critical part of putting together the early product for the February trade show that changed the trajectory of this company. In fact, he sought out and closed a deal with Jasper Roofing which is to date our biggest customer, and signed them up for 4 passes -- 1500 dollars at the time. We couldnt have been more thrilled -- that was 15% of the months revenue and 62.5% of the last months revenue. We couldnt believe it! From there, he helped develop, along with Nikhil, the original training script. Since then he\\'s made a number of immensely valuable contributions to the team, both technically and otherwise. Now, he\\'s preparing to start his own company and I proudly told him that I\\'d like to be his first investor and that he\\'s welcome to get it kicked off out of our office in San Francisco. Jacob will always be a part of Shogun\\'s history and fabric, as his contributions have been very significant both concretely and in terms of what he brought to our culture. I\\'m very proud to report that he seems to have gotten what he was initially seeking -- the experience to confidently go off on his own venture. I\\'m proud of this. Ambition and the desire for a better future are the antidotes to physical reality which is defined by entropy [the loss of energy, form, structure as a function of time]. Jacob exemplifies what we try to achieve here and what we\\'re committed to as a company. When he joined he helped us face down multiple problems and he never gave up. I wish him and everyone who departs, great luck in the future endeavors and I\\'m a proud supporter of his. His company will be the second to be birthed out of ours! All great companies beget great companies, because great companies are made up of great people.\\n\\nAmazing, amazing week everyone, incredible month. I thought we\\'d be celebrating 100x Year over Year this month, but it turns out that that itself was not even close to reality, we beat it! Enjoy it, because 100x from here may take a lot longer than a year, but I can guarantee one thing based on the last 2.5 years .. it\\'ll all be worth it!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAG'),\n",

The big win of the week was wrapping up the build for the new app -- I\\'ve mentioned this to a couple of people already but in terms of product quality that is the strongest deliverable I\\'ve seen the company produce since inception. Really great work. Now lets see what the users think of it! In other news, I was very pleased to see that HomeAdvisor\\'s partnership seems to be genuinely generative for us, we\\'ve had almost 10 customers sign up through homeadvisor this week including a good few on self serve which suggests a very high level of intent. We\\'ll continue to benefit from this integration until February, and then we\\'ll either expand the partnership if we win their \"auction\" or lose it then. Whats more the part of the existing integration that they have advised is the most valuable has yet to go live -- it\\'ll go live on November 6th, when we get blasted out to their 190k contractors as part of their monthly newsletter. I spent some time in Charleston this week as well, where I had the chance to visit with the AMS team. Some really interesting developments came out of that that I\\'m eager to share with everyone. I\\'m looking forward to bringing our company culture to the office there as I think we\\'ll get a lot out of that. Hopefully the deal will wrap up this week that way we can start counting their revenue towards ours starting in November. Until then, lets push hard especially in Austin to hit 200k this month. My hope is that we can grow our core business to 250k a month by the end of next month while stacking on 70-90k from AMS and wrapping up the year close to a 4m run rate.\\n\\nExcited to kick off next week at Natoma street for the first time. Thank you to everyone who moved desks there.\\n\\nLast but not least I wanted to include a note on our values. As you know we\\'re working on instituting values, mission, and performance reviews as part of our second objective of building a stronger foundation for the company. I’ve always struggled with this exercise, as we tend towards a consensus based approach to these things, especially in Silicon Valley, that renders a lot of the outcomes homogenous, vague and signaling oriented versus reflective or ambitious. I also thought quite a bit about why our current values, although great, didn’t necessarily ring true to me on a day to day basis. Company values can either be there, floating in the background of a company, or they can be front and center around decision making and how we deal with one another. One piece of feedback I got for a while around our original set of values was that I was not doing enough to point out how the values influenced certain decisions that were made. Although the process of communicating these values is an important muscle to develop, I could not help but feel to some degree that with our current values it would be more forced than I would have liked. My conclusion from all of this was that we should not leave the status quo the way it is and I do not think scrapping the exercise is fair to us as it suggests we have no values, so I’ve spent a lot of time thinking and reading about how this process is done well, as well as what values I authentically believe in as we build this company. Here is my first attempt:\\n\\nThree core values:\\n\\nMutual\\nbenefit seems pretty random and tame, but I actually think there is a lot more\\nto it than it initially suggests. Mutual benefit is the fundamental mechanism\\nfor human coordination. It is the engine that drives society forward by\\nallowing us to coordinate with strangers, and more importantly create\\npositive-sum complicity and collaboration as a society. Everything around us\\nhas been brought here by thousands of people coordinating for mutual benefit.\\nFrom the plastic on the keyboard I’m typing on to the water I’m drinking we’re\\ntalking about thousands and thousands of instances where humans that are\\notherwise unknown to one another are interacting for their own good and by\\nvirtue of this creating value for others. This simple concept is what has lifted\\nour entire species out of abject poverty and chaos.\\n\\nInteractions\\nthat are not couched in mutual benefit do not weather the natural challenges of\\nreality. Implicit in this framework is a belief that there are natural cycles\\nto the human experience, and there is no finality to success or failure,\\nmeaning that things necessarily\\xa0go wrong and you need to believe that you can get what you\\nwant by fighting through tough times.\\n\\nWin\\nlose dynamics create lose lose outcomes, I’ve seen this happen many times. So\\nthe question becomes, what needs to be true for a mutual benefit to come about.\\nThe first thing that seems obvious is that there needs to be a sense of what is\\nwanted or sought after by both parties. So if you do not have clarity on\\nwhat you’re looking for it makes coordinating for mutual benefit very difficult\\nif not impossible. This is a key reason why in every single interview I’ve done\\nfor us at Shogun, I’ve asked the same question “what do you hope to get from\\nyour next opportunity” and I then think seriously about whether or not the\\nspecific opportunity that person is searching for has the potential to give\\nthem that experience. That is so critical to the way we’ve built the team,\\nevery single person in our company has a sense of what they want to accomplish\\nand what they want to gain from this experience, and I see it as a key part of\\nmy job to help them accomplish that via this experience or help guide them to\\nanother opportunity that will get them what they seek. I truly believe you can\\nnot have A+ performance unless a person sees a light at the end of the tunnel. I dont want anyone here to be working for Shogun for its own sake, I want everyone here to be working at Shogun for their own sake. I think you pour fire on that if the path to the goal is meaningfully\\ndifferentiated from alternative options.\\n\\nHowever,\\nthe concept of mutual benefit implies more than one party. So there is another\\nside to the story — the needs of the company. Not only does the company need to\\nprovide a path to an outcome, the person needs to contribute to the company in\\nsuch a way that it is logical and in our interest to coordinate/develop that path.\\nIn the same way that the individual needs to have a coherent sense of the\\ninterest they are pursuing, the company needs to have a good understanding of\\nwhat it is looking for from the individual, that their contributions are in\\nline with what the company believes it needs. Once both of these conditions are\\ntrue, the outcomes are incredible and powerful. These are the fundamental\\nstructures that have led us to this point as a company.\\n\\nThis\\nis also an important value for us to take into consideration when thinking\\nabout our customers and our partners. Our customers have particular problems\\nthat they are looking for us to solve, and they exchange money with us in order\\nto have use our technology to solve that problem. One of the things I find most\\nexciting about our business model is that we have a financial incentive to help\\nthe contractor use the product successfully. I think this aligns interest and\\npromotes coordination for mutual benefit.\\n\\nOn\\na side note, I think the power of our product is that we are using technology\\nto promote multiparty coordination for mutual benefit. If you think about the\\ndiversity of parties that are coordinating to create the successful use of our\\nproduct, its truly awe-inspiring and powerful. We have three main customer\\ngroups — contractors, homeowners and lenders. Most of these parties have never\\ncoordinating with each other in the past. Our SaaS products allows for each\\nparty to interact for mutual benefit:\\n\\nThe homeowner is able to execute a needed repair by virtue of the financing that we enable them with.\\n\\nThe contractor wins business\\nby offering the financing to the homeowner, its clear from our very early data\\nthat there is an enormous ROI potential associated with the successful use of\\nour product.\\n\\nThe lender finds a homeowner\\nin a category that is very difficult to pin down from a distribution\\nperspective and is given the opportunity to develop a relationship with\\nhim/her.\\n\\nAll\\nof this thanks to our own coordination.\\n\\nSlope\\nis a mathematical term for the direction of a line on a graph. High\\npositive slope means that something is moving up and to the right, high\\nnegative slope means that its moving down and to the right, no slope means its\\na straight line that maintains a given y coordinate. Stefano I can feel you cringing as you read this, but you all get the point.\\n\\nHumans\\ncan coordinate in a generative way and create synergistic outcomes, but this is\\nbasically not a natural behavior for our universe. Physicists understand that\\nthere is a natural phenomenon called entropy, and we can see it all over the\\nplace and in every aspect of human life. Entropy, like gravity, is a rule of\\nthe universe. It means that as a function of time complex systems decay. Slope,\\nin this sense, is the opposite of entropy. It represents generation over time,\\nimprovement, iteration and rise. This is a critical component because it\\ninfluences how we hire people and how we approach problems in our company. On\\nthe first subject, the hard and fast rule is slope over y-intercept. For those\\nof you who dosed off in math class in middle school, a line is represented in\\nalgebra as y=mx+b. Where you can represent any line by knowing its y-intercept\\n[b] [where it encounters the y axis] and its slope [m]. The rule here is that\\nif there are two lines where one has a higher slope than the other but a lower\\ny intercept, the line with the higher slope will always surpass the lower slope\\nas a function of time [x]. How does that relate to us? People are similar. You\\nhave people who have incredible y-intercepts, they have accomplished a\\ntremendous amount, but at the end of the day, we need to staff this company\\nwith people who have insane slopes, the ability to learn and adapt as well as\\nimprove through friction. To have a high slope, someone needs to take a proactive\\napproach to problem solving as well as identifying and constructively\\naddressing weakness/barriers to improvement. Problems occur naturally, and they\\ngenerally speaking exert entropic forces if you don’t combat them actively. One\\nneeds to approach problems with a mind towards solving them under any\\nconditions in order to overcome the problem stronger, but it requires a lot\\nmore effort and courage than resigning oneself to a problem in the short term.\\n\\nSlope is all about future growth and opportunity, its about where we\\'re headed not where we are. It means we\\'re a company thats always looking for opportunity and always looking to improve, that bets on ourselves and each other and sees opportunity in problems.\\n\\nSlope\\n& Business — slope is what we’re all after, its why the contractors are\\njoining our business. We provide them with greater slope.\\n\\nTruth\\nis one of the most important values we can have as a company. By setting truth\\nas a core company value, we are saying that getting to the truth is the single\\nmost important aspect of any interaction we have with one another, as well as\\nwith external parties. There are many dynamics that emerge where the truth is\\nobvious, but due primarily to social dynamics, it is not shared. Joining this\\ncompany should mean that you are committed to hearing and sharing the truth no\\nmatter what, and that you subordinate the natural discomfort associated with\\noccasionally sharing non-flattering truths, with the understanding that once\\nunderstood, the challenges they belie will be addressed and solved. Truth is\\ncritical to a business, as having a lucid understanding of existential risks\\nand gaps is what allows us to deploy solutions against them. Ignoring the\\ntruth, or tip toeing around it is very easy, but it creates more problems than\\nit solves. Unsolved problems tend not to solve themselves. This plays out in many\\ndifferent ways. Because we are a business we are structured in such a way where\\nthe key goal of our shared enterprise is to succeed and build more value into\\nthe company. Many times there are obvious barriers to achieving that that are\\nhard to confront because they are big ambiguous problems. Those truths should\\nbe addressed promptly and directly if we are to succeed as a business. The more\\nthat we dance with delusion, the further we will get from reality and from resolving the key\\nproblem sets that serve as a gating function for future success. This does not mean that truth is so\\nimportant and valuable that one can communicate it in any way without concern.\\nCommunication is important and building positive sum relationships is critical,\\nso truth is important but with it we all commit to discipline around how we\\nshare truth and when we communicate it. That being said, there should never be\\na trade off where we decide to be liked or popular versus telling the truth,\\nespecially as it relates to the business. We hold truth in the utmost esteem\\nhere at Shogun, and we do not peddle illusions that make us feel good but do\\nnot relate to reality. Many companies keep their team in the dark about reality\\nand truth in order to protect morale. This is a fairly patronizing way of going\\nabout building a company, we expect everyone who joins the team to be an\\ninvested in the businesses success and as such be able to handle the good bad\\nand ugly that come along with building a fast growing technology company.\\n\\nWe\\'ll likely review this along with performance reviews and a mission statement at some point in the not too distant future. In the mean time I wanted to share my latest thinking with everyone, curious to get any feedback.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We started the\\nweek thinking that SRS would have fallen through, but they turned out to send\\nout their first campaign which is a big milestone in our channel partnerships\\nstrategy. At the same time we’re starting to engage GAF where there is a huge\\npotential for a strong partnership, looking forward to running that pilot\\nthroughout most of end of Q3 and Q4. Not much progress on HomeAdvisor,\\nunfortunately, but hopefully we’ll start to hear more this coming week.\\n\\nAustin made us proud this week too, with one of our biggest\\nrevenue weeks ever. The energy in the office is a palpable testament to the\\nquality of the team there and Scott’s leadership. Fantastic work going on. We\\nbrought on a new sales rep who will be joining us in early September and\\ntweaked our strategy for next month to focus on more clearly delineating between\\nour inside sales strategy and our outbound sales strategy [warm leads versus\\ncold calls]. The hope here is that it will leave us at the end of September\\nwith a concrete sense of what works/doesn’t as well as whats possible with\\noutbound in addition to allowing both scripts to develop in parallel. Eager to\\nsee what comes of that!\\n\\nSome big internal developments this week, as you all know\\nthis was Jakub, Jonathan and Simran’s last week. While its always sad to see\\npeople go, I’m proud of the way that they all left and of the fact that they\\nall reported having enriching experiences here. As many of you know too, next\\nweek is Will’s last week. Will was here from day 1 so his departure is a big\\none, but we’re all very thankful for everything that he’s done for us and\\nbrought to this company as well as very excited and eager to see what he\\naccomplishes with Mojo, the new company he is starting! All of these transition\\npoints have been in the works for many months, and I’m really pleased and proud\\nof the level of integrity and care everyone who has transitioned out has\\ndisplayed, particularly around ensuring that the company is prepared for their\\ndeparture and that their core workflows are off boarded and documented\\ncorrectly. It’s a fantastic testament to the level of good faith and authentic\\ncommitment to supporting people internally around finding opportunities that\\nalign with their goals, that everyone has left the company in a stronger place\\nthan they came into.\\n\\nIn other news, we’re excited to have Stefano back! Next week\\nwe have some big initiatives, most important of which is probably shooting out\\nour new app with on-boarding. Its always incredible to see the engineering team\\nband together around a problem like they have this week, and push something\\nstrong out at the end of it. Thank you to all of you for putting in the extra\\nhours there, and pushing for excellence.\\n\\nAs I mentioned in state of the start up, we’re tracking fairly\\nwell against our goals. I’m optimistic about our revenue goal, of hitting 166k\\na month by next month, especially given how we’re tracking so far this month.\\nOn engagement, we’re making very steady progress, and I’m equally optimistic\\nabout whats possible there. I think on the number of contractors goal, we’re\\ngoing to perhaps fall a bit short in the absence of a secular acquisition\\nstrategy success, like an e-mail campaign converting a lot more people than we\\nexpect out of our funnel or a channel partnership going really well really\\nfast. Either way, I’m very proud of where we are as a company and how we’re\\ntracking.\\n\\nNext week will be an interesting one as we close out what is\\nslated to be our best month ever from a cash income perspective. Looking\\nforward to kicking it off bright and early with you all!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

This is actually a very good thing, as we've been trailing an average of 2 days behind our goal this entire month, in part due to the fact that we've seen self serve on facebook die out with increased spend and audience iteration, but this week we made a ton of progress in getting our costs down there and making it work better, most importantly the new timeline which I think was designed and built in record time, as well as a couple of the other tests we ran. We're going to need to keep this iteration pace up to make this work, so I'm glad to see that we went into this month wide eyed about the challenges we'd faced and we've been pretty systematic about approaching them and addressing them while making time to address technical debt and longstanding projects in the background. As a consequence, we're pacing towards just under 60k, but another day like Monday of this week [where we broke 4k in one day] can change that so we have to keep up the momentum. The new language at the top of the sign up page is also working out fairly well and has churned out some self serve annual plans over the weekend which is promising. We've found some errors in the way that mode is reporting the results, which is somewhat concerning and could in turn explain why our funded loan volume has dropped, as we used those same dashboards to figure out whether the new offer page was outperforming the old one. In any case, I think we're taking a strong and rigorous approach to testing and measuring that has become our core competency as a team via months of iterating on the buildzoom flow.\\n\\nIts also looking like we're going to be getting buildzoom to help us acquire contractors which is exciting, and very promising. At this rate our cheapest source of contractors has been thumbtack, and we've seen some of their contractors actually use the product which is a good sign. If we can prove out this contractor marketplace model itll be easy to reproduce across other contractor networks as those businesses are looking to do what they can to increase their revenue per contractor as you can imagine.\\n\\nOn another note, we'll all be missing scott in the office as he heads over to Austin to bring Shea onto our team, our newest team member and the first member of Scott's new team.\\n\\nFinally, we are starting to make big moves on our new office, so we hope to get more clarity on that this week. The new place looks great and I'm eager for all of you to check it out.\\n\\nTo close, I'd like to thank Anthony Vitarelli for hosting us at his house this past week. I'm glad we're doing more team building, I think its a great aspect of our company and its important. The first month of culture panel has been a great success, so thank you Will for coming up with that and to everyone involved in implementing it.\\n\\nBig ten days ahead of us as we push for 60, looks like getting to 500k run rate is the downside case, which is in a certain way a good thing!\\n\\nHave a great rest of your weekend!\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Stellar week last week, a\\nlot of best days ever under our belt this month. We’re tracking very well for\\nour 20k goal this month, but we’ve got to keep up the energy as to hit it as things\\nare not as repeatable as they’d need to be for us to feel comfortable at this\\nstage. A couple of new aspects to our company are in the works, one key one is\\nsales which Anthony V has done a great job mapping out and recruiting for, the\\nother is some form of customer success. I had six or so calls Saturday morning\\nfrom people just calling the number that texts them, so customers are at our\\ndoor ready to engage, we need to come up with a more systematic way of\\ninterfacing with them and make sure none of them slip through the cracks. I\\nexpect we’ll make some headway on the sales plan this week as we have a couple\\nof on-sites and an interesting ex-AMS exec who has some notes to share and is\\neager to learn more about what we’re building and potentially get involved.\\n\\nWe’re going to face some growing pain over the course of the\\nnext couple months as we figure out how to adapt to and serve our new and\\ngrowing customer base in such a way that positions ourselves as a\\npro-contractor player in this market. This is a natural part of the growth\\nprocess, and chaos is actually quite good. WE’ve just got to make sure that\\nwe’re not becoming too reactive and still keep the broader vision in mind so\\nthat we’re moving intentionally as opposed to reactively. I still think one of\\nthe bigger opportunities here is around insurance distribution, especially if\\nwe’re able to develop a contractor dashboard that they interact with, and I’ve\\nreached out to a couple of our friends in the insurance industry to start to\\nmap that out in a bit more detail this week. We should also make sure that\\nduring this phase we’re taking advantage of all these closed customers to get\\nfeedback from them and testimonials for our marketing. There are likely still\\nkey messaging optimizations we can be making, and its also maybe clear that we\\nshould set up a drip for listed leads which is the step after click-offer on\\nour conversion funnel. Its all hands on deck here.\\n\\nAs we approach the end of the month I’d encourage everyone\\nto think about where we want to go in Q2. We’ll be running the same goal\\nsetting process as we had in Q1 so I’d love for everyone to come with some\\nideas about where we should try to take the company this quarter.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

My latest count has us at just under $2300 for the month already! We're hitting march strong, and in the first couple days here it looks like we're on track to eclipse January already which is a great sign. Last month was phenomenal. We closed 18 loans, with only 5 coming from negative unit economic channels [facebook], which we've made a lot of progress on. Our final count for February is 10,058.56 I believe which puts us at over 4x January and a bit over the goal we'd set at the beginning of the quarter. The real challenge going forward will be about getting to 20k but I believe we have a solid game plan to get there. For those of you who dont know here is the game plan:\\n\\n$13,000 from Contractor subscriptions: This is 43 annual subscriptions, with 15 coming from facebook, 15 coming from AMS campaigns, 10 coming from the expo and 3 existing leads converting onto our product. I believe that in order to get there, we're going to have to make that annual subscription look more attractive by bumping up the price of the monthly subscription [and thereby increasing the attractiveness of the other one]. I also think this will mean we'll be able to focus on delivering a best in class product to our contractors versus worrying about short run churn. But I want to discuss it internally before making a move there.\\n\\n$5000 from personal loans. My view is that this is highly attainable given that we have 47 listed loans from February alone and all the traffic we will generate this month + the contractors starting to close loans. This month we made around $3400 from loans, up about 50% over last month!\\n\\n$2000 from secured products: We made $1200 this month and I think with more dedicated support and direction we'll be able to juice this to $2k + we have some tricks up our sleeves like sending all the qualified leads in the states we're live in who did not fund an e-mail to check rates on home equity loans!\\n\\nThis assumes 0 from credit cards and 0 from freedom debt relief where we have over 20 leads pending. The final numbers may not look anything like this, but the point is to break it down and create objectives to show just how achievable 20k this month is. We can do this. I am wiping a lot of my schedule for this month in order to man support and sales in the short term as we figure out how to build out that org.\\n\\nBeyond all of the high level success, we also had a great month in terms of our funnel. Our approval rate is up 10% with some of our new lenders, and most importantly our listed rate is up 50% to just under 9% [I believe this will go over 9% once the one main loans are input if they are not already].\\n\\nWe have an exciting week ahead of us, we'll do a lot of follow up and launch some new interesting marketing campaigns. We'll also work on our contractor landing page where it seems our newest iteration is outperforming our older ones. This week is also Janna's first week, she joins us in Connie's stead on Wednesday so please be sure to give her a warm welcome! We're going to miss Connie though!\\n\\nHope you all had a restful weekend, we're going to hit the ground running first thing monday!\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Solid week under our belt, with a lot of progress on our product vision, the realtor integration and identifying/solving our bottom of the funnel issue. Special shout out goes to Zak and Jacob for nailing the realtor white label in a week flat. This kind of efficacy gives us a huge competitive advantage, and makes us very attractive to future channel partners. Great work.\\n\\nThe fundraise is going well, we're on track to close at least $1,000,000 before the end of the month if not more. This extra padding paired with our strong spend control will give us the longevity to hit this market hard. My thoughts on this phase of a company boil down to -- get as many shots on goal as possible and dont give up. 14 or so months into this company its feeling like that strategy pays off as I mentioned in state of the start up. We're raising up to $2,000,000 on a 24 cap, meaning that we'll be diluted a maximum of 2/26th in exchange for roughly ten months of runway [assuming no revenue or burn growth].\\n\\nI'm optimistic that we'll have the tools to solve the bottom of the funnel issue before the end of the month. This is where my focus is going to be for the remainder of the quarter. We've instrumented the funnel, we've reached out to customers, we're running AB tests, we're limiting the offers people see, and I think ultimately we'll see more closed loans as a ratio of qualified leads this month as a result. That being said we've had a solid week this week, with $42,000 in closed loans. If we can keep this pace up we might be able to get to $200,000k for the month, which would be a solid improvement over the $96,000 we closed last month. All this being said I think that this phase we should not be too focused on metrics, but rather focused on figuring out a solution to the problem. So I'm excited about some of the experiments we're running.\\n\\nGreat conversation at state of the start up, I imagine that that will be the first of many very good ones. These types of questions dont have a clear and single answer, the balance is ultimately decided and then recalibrate by staying conscious of how we're investing our resources and constantly reevaluating that.\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nQuarterly Goals:\\n\\n•500 Qualified Leads a month in December\\n\\nClose 100 Loans\\n\\n•Sell a credit card lead:\\n\\n500 Qualified Leads a month in December\\n\\n•Licensed in CA, TX, NJ, OH, CT and NC for loan brokerage.

As we near the end of the first month of the quarter, I wanted to use this time to step back and evaluate our goals for this quarter, which ends on September 30th, in 10 weeks. Here they are with some notes below them:\\n\\nIAC Pilot\\n\\n100 Loans\\n\\n50 Accounts on Platform Beta\\n\\nInsurance Beta Product\\n\\nThe IAC Pilot unfortunately is not likely to happen by the end of the quarter. This is because HomeAdvisor is locked into a deal with Prosper until 2018, and even though its possible we can get them to break the contract, this will likely take time. My goal is to convince them to let us pilot with Angie\\'s List and then if it works well transfer it over to Homeadvisor. IAC only comes into control Angie\\'s List in q4 of this year, so the soonest we could use that angle would be the forth quarter. That being said I hope to get some kind of LOI going before the end of the quarter and I\\'m talking to Homeadvisor this week.\\n\\nThe accounts piece is going to receive some serious thought this week. My view is that our best shot at getting platform beta customers is to leverage our existing flow to get people to get accounts with hearth, where they are saving their rates by putting a password behind them [and then they can re access them with a password]. I know this is going to be complicated but this is probably the only way we\\'ll get to 50 by the end of the quarter. Shannon and Jakub have been doing some serious thinking here.\\n\\nI am confident we\\'ll be able to beta test the insurance product by the end of the quarter. We have great leads with Liberty Mutual [we should be reviewing an agreement with them as early as this coming week] and Hippo. At the same time I should be licensed as a broker by the end of the month/August 1st.\\n\\n10 Loans\\n\\n25+ PB Customers\\n\\nRevenue CAC on Adwords\\n\\nThe only thing I\\'ll comment on here is the CAC on adwords. I think we\\'re already starting to see what it costs to get a \"qualified lead\" here, and as we start to understand the conversion from qualified lead to loan we\\'ll be able to back out what we\\'re willing to pay on adwords. In the mean time its been wonderful talking to customers -- its super insightful and useful. We are solving a real problem for people and its great to talk to them about it. More on that another time.\\xa0\\n\\n3 Core Values\\n\\n1 Loan\\n\\nBuildzoom Deep Integration\\n\\nDesigner Hire\\n\\nPlatform Beta\\n\\nExperian\\n\\nState Licenses\\n\\nAudit\\n\\nTop 10 for long Tail\\n\\nLaunch Hearth Brand\\n\\nWith Will\\'s excellent culture meeting we\\'re on track to hit the three core values by the end of the quarter. We blew goal 2 out of the water this week. Buildzoom is bought into the deep integration and will give us a date when we meet again in two weeks. We hired the designer. The platform beta is underway, we still have quite a bit more mapping out to do on that side. Anthony and Jakub have been doing a great job leading the experian piece, I\\'m confident we\\'ll get membership come October, which is the end of the quarter. Vitarelli and Will have got the state licenses and audit under control, that is very much on track. We saw Brandon\\'s SEO magic start to work this week with the home improvement loan calculator, we should map out more what getting this would look like and specific key words, but this seems attainable. If it is in our best interest, we have the cannons lined up for an epic launch.\\n\\nBig take away -- lets get two loans next week + this is going to be a hell of a quarter.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

There were a lot of late nights last week but I think this is the logical next step for our funnel. Excited to see what monday tuesday surge suggests about our e-mail capture rates. At the same time Brandon launched a massive ad buy campaign on google which has been very interesting to learn from. The early numbers look somewhat promising, but it is very hard to tell how profitable these buys will be in the short term. I've been calling people who submit loan applications which has been an extremely interesting experience -- excited to share my notes with you all. The big key for us is finding credit worthy leads, that being said the imminent addition of avant and freedom financial to the hearth platform will make for a stronger conversion engine on our end. This all cumulated in 32 completed applications on Hearth this week, which is a stronger position than we've been in, although we still have a lot of work to go in terms of converting these leads and understanding their journeys. That being said I foresee a lot of progress as we learn from our customers and develop a brand and content here. I'm confident that this loan brokerage is whats going to take us to the 85k in december figure. My early sense is we still have a lot of work in terms of finding out exactly when people should use personal loans and do use personal loans. I have a couple of ideas for how we can monetize this funnel in the next few months -- they include adding credit cards, and trying to move our lender relationships from closed loan basis to lead basis as well as calling leads to close them on the phone. Its going to be a tough sell given our volume but hopefully we can price it at somewhat of a discount and given that we can multiply loans [one application is 5 leads] it may be a very smart starting point as we shift towards a broader product vision. Brandon did a great job concretizing the product journey that we have for the current iteration of hearth v1. Which is almost like Education via quiz and content -> tools -> product identification through the loan brokerage. Our meeting with Bhaskar was very interesting primarily because his big emphasis was on adding value to the consumer through our content, and developing trust and brand as a conversion tool long term. He emphasized that nerdwallet's first few years were just grinding to get customers, much in the same way that we're doing. A couple years and 115m in annual revenue later, they're pretty happy they did it ! Finally it was great to buckle everything up with Buildzoom this week. Its going to make it much easier to plan around that partnership in the broader context of what we're up to going forward.\\n\\nAt the same time Shannon has been really leading the company on two key fronts. The first being insurance where she has honed in on an incredible opportunity -- builders risk insurance. To that end we've schedule a meeting with Zurich which is the largest [or second largest] carrier for builders risk insurance. At the same time she's led the charge in terms of touching base with our customers and is planning on running us through everything she's learned. Shannon -- thank you for all of your great work.\\n\\nLots of other key wins this week including getting the IAC intro [we're hitting the CEO and a senior BD guy at the same time] and following up with someone from porch next week. I'm also going to find some time to sit down with the Chairman of Houzz in the next couple of weeks. I still believe there is a big opportunity in using marketplaces as merchants given their scale. Even if buildzoom ends up being a zero, that doesnt mean we shouldnt try to see more -- we really have a strong competitive edge for these types of marketplaces, especially as we learn to monetize our users in the methods mentioned above.\\n\\nMore broadly I'm excited and confident about our vision regarding visualizing the home. Its a complicated transaction and asset thats linked to the financial market in a deep way. Most people dont really see their homes as financial assets, which presents a unique opportunity to teach them how they could have more money at the end of the month with minor optimizations. That being said this part is still early but a key project for July. Unfortunately House Canary came back a 0, I spoke to their head of research and they dont have building permits so they cant draw conclusions about home value. My bias here is to use less fine data in the short term as we beta test such a product offering out. I think it could attract a lot of backlinks and press.\\n\\nThe biggest goal for me continues to be making sure we have a strong culture and our processes are such that we're leveraging the fact that we're a start up and everyones strengths. Its important in this respect that we all be aware and vocal about what we think could be better and ways to improve our company. The new interns are going to experience the culture as we've created it and I want to create something we're truly proud of. That being said I am very proud of this team and the way we've really zero'ed into problem solving mode over the course of the last couple of months.\\n\\nAnthony and Will have been doing some great if non-salient work in the background to strategize around our state expansion. The most important state is California by far -- ignoring that its the largest market in the country -- nothing beats the ability to test features with customers in our back yard, thats something I'm eager to accomplish by the end of the year. Our investor, Adrian Fenty, is helping advise us on that front.\\n\\nThe following are the big goals for this week! As well as testing messaging based on some of the phone calls I've had. Sorry I'm out tomorrow, but I'm looking forward to catching up with everyone on Tuesday afternoon. I'll be out again in the south bay for a board meeting with Joe on Friday and then the following Monday, but other than a week in august this should be all the time I'm taking off. I somewhat overcommitted myself at the beginning of the year thinking June and July would figure itself out. Feel free to call me if anything comes up as a couple of you know I'm always online! Eager to push forward next week and really excited to welcome Scott this week and Gavin next week. Looks like Scott's going to be working on our internal metrics and Gavin's going to be mapping out what other companies are touching home/finance in the ways we're thinking of it.\\n\\nNext week's priorities:\\n\\nProbably above all of these is solving our reporting issues, looks like there is still some work to be done on that front.\\n\\nHomepage Redesign\\n\\nAB Test e-mail Capture\\n\\nSegments Launch 2\\n\\nDevelop plan for nurture re-targeting\\n\\nOffers Page Design\\n\\nLoan Flow User Tests\\n\\nFB Quiz Push\\n\\nScott On-Boarding\\n\\nGoogle Analytics Funnels and Dashboards\\n\\nLead Generation Monetization Strategy\\n\\nLoan Messaging Test\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

The big goal this week was to get 2 loans, and we\\'ll find out tomorrow whether we did that. We know we \"got\" the prosper loan but unfortunately I dont think its honest to count it as a win given that we didnt make any money on it. \\n\\nI\\'d be happy if we hit the goal, if we didnt then we add the one we missed to next week and the goal becomes to hit five loans. I also think its going to be progressively easier to convert loans for the simple reason that not everyone who applies and gets rates they like will make the decision on the spot. And every consecutive week we have the benefit of all of the prior week\\'s qualified loan applications. Speaking of which this was a huge area of improvement for us. Two weeks ago I counted 7 qualified loan applications, this week we had 21. A lot of that was driven by paid ads, we\\'ve actually had great traction with buildzoom lately, and we\\'re starting to get some conversions to qualified leads off of the contractor pages which is something that we never had before. I\\'m excited to see what this deep integration yields and in the mean time I think there is a lot of low hanging fruit in terms of what we can do with our loan flow [i.e make the first couple questions softballs that you click on vs PII] that may increase the rate at which people complete the applications. Also when Jakub Zak and I were brainstorming blockscore we had a couple other ideas that have yet to be implemented. We\\'re also getting pretty strong traction with paintzen which would be our second home improvement marketplace, a big milestone for us.\\n\\nAs I said on Friday I see insurance as a redemption for all of the things we could have done better when thinking about the loan brokerage. Getting buildzoom to let us test messaging, creative on the rest of their website was and is a huge win for us. We can start to optimize the funnel, messaging, landing pages way earlier in the process. Not only that, Shannon has been doing great work figuring out how people think about insurance when they\\'re remodeling and lining up potential partners. Speaking of which I\\'m hoping we start iterating on a deal with Liberty Mutual this week. Last week was an interesting one for insurance, I\\'ve obviously been neck deep in it given this test, but the homeadvisor call indicated that its a strong differentiating factor for us which was a clear signal that our strategy and thinking with respect to verticalizing and cross selling products around home improvement would give us a competitive advantage with respect to engaging channel partners. I dont think we\\'re necessarily at the point where we\\'re ready to dedicate a lot of engineering and marketing resources to it, but I think testing out low tech strategies is the way to go here. I\\'ll also be trying to call and sell people myself once I am a licensed broker.\\n\\nI\\'m leaving out a ton of other exciting things like us settling in on cultural values, getting license applications filed in key states, iterating productively on e-mail marketing, starting retargeting, making a lot of progress with respect to backlinks and organic traffic etc. Its pretty astonishing how much gets done in a week at Shogun :)\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

This coming week is the real beginning of the quarter for us. The momentum we bring into this week will define -- in my opinion -- the rest of the quarter. We've got a couple of big ships moving ahead. Big accomplishment to have rounded up our board agreement and gotten all of the ducks in the row to start submitting state licenses this week -- Anthony and Will did a great job getting it done. Not to mention we had the pleasure of welcoming John, who kicked off his time at Shogun working away at mantle. Buildzoom sent us two qualified leads today, which is new an very much welcomed. We'll see what we're doing right and try to recreate it. We're also getting avant on board next week, which is big. My hypothesis is that our first loan will be an avant loan.\\n\\nI want to run a completely different flow through buildzoom next week. In my conversations with mentors and advisors as well as senior product people I've learned a couple of key things:\\n\\n1) Iterating on color, copy, layout can help, but it will not take you from zero to one. [although I think it can if we're creating a strong funnel with buildzoom as we are. Real iterations are big hypothesis about user journeys that are tested.\\n\\n2) 80%+ of SoFi's personal loan business is towards people who have LTV ratios that are too high to get home equity lines. We need to find those people on buildzoom, with new copy, new creative and a completely different flow as a test. I want to put that in place by the end of this week/ early next week.\\n\\n3) Creatives increased Upstart's conversion through e-mail by 300%. We need a designer badly to help us communicate with customers visually.\\n\\nI have a bunch of notes on the product that I'll be sharing as well -- including that we should create a fake ticker [shout out to Zak for suggesting this] when you finish the quiz as well as potentially purge a couple of questions on the quiz depending where the drop off is. We really need to be thinking about how to capture e-mail, the quiz is an excellent segmentation tool.\\n\\nThis weekend I'll have cleared 10 hours of the course on insurance, learning a lot of useful stuff, and hopefully we'll get licensed by the end of this month. Excited for the meeting with liberty mutual -- also reached out to my friend at met life. The biggest thing, this week though, for me at least, is going to be the IAC meeting. I'm doing a call with Keri tomorrow evening to figure out what their current deal with prosper is. Exciting stuff. Lots of top of the funnel possibilities to manage here. Lots of big learnings this week around the product, messaging and use cases for the personal loan which I'm excited to share throughout the course of the week. We'll be wrapping the week up with a secret trip that Will has planned, and although I hate to lose precious time in the office, we are only going to win if we have a massively productive and synergistic culture, and investing in the team is never a loss of time -- I expect to see you all there!\\n\\nTwo pretty great recruits in the funnel this week -- hopefully we'll be able to close them both within the week -- David and Jacob. Both are extremely talented, and given the way things generally go I see it as unlikely that we close both, but such is life. That being said a start up is about betting big on the best case scenario and if we just take a step back and look at what will happen if this week goes well:\\n\\n1. We'll be on our way to getting our pilot with IAC\\n\\n2. We'll close great talent for the company\\n\\n3. We'll have gotten our licenses effectively throughout the US, at least in major states.\\n\\n4. We may have the beginnings of pilots with dFree, Paintzen, and Liberty Mutual.\\n\\n5. We'll get our new website up, with the homepage etc.\\n\\n6. We'll be ready to rock with a completely new flow off buildzoom to capture e-mail, as well as have a weeks worth of data on the results page's performance.\\n\\n7. We'll have Avant up and running and hopefully freedom's API keys to test it out.\\n\\n8. We'll have come around a couple of core and defining values for the company.\\n\\nAnd if we get none of those things, we'll be wiser, smarter and stronger because of it!\\n\\nSee you all tomorrow :)\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Its been an amazing journey, but its far from over. I still think we’re at less than 1% of the potential of the business if executed properly.\\n\\nTo that end, the team spent a good amount of time this week looking at what we want to accomplish in Q4. This week individual teams are going to work on developing their own objectives and key results.\\n\\nAs usual we were aligned that the two central areas of focus for the business are going to revolve around improving our acquisition and increasing our engagement, probably with a slight bias towards focus on engagement efforts. Within that realm, we divided engagement into three buckets - activation, re-engagement and churn. Activation is related to on-boarding - how quickly can we get our customers to see the value of our product and become repeat users? Re-engagement is a new focus for us, it has to do with the customers that slipped through the onboarding cracks and have gone months without using (in some cases, having never used) the product. Here we want to focus primarily on the January - March 2019 cohorts to see if we can drive engagement before their subscriptions come up for renewal in 2020. We’re going to be testing a number of tactics to see whats possible there. On the churn side, the goal for the quarter beyond just improving and addressing churn, is going to be around understanding and measuring it. The key result that would be valuable here is to understand what drives churn and specifically what kind of demographic/utilization/geographic factors contribute to it.\\n\\nAs far as acquisition our focus is going to be on improving our unit economics - i.e how much money we net per customer and the time frame for getting paid back on our acquisition efforts. Right now both inbound and outbound have room to improve in this respect, and there is a consensus that we can drive meaningful returns here. The second initiative under this objective is going to be around launching an affiliates channel. We know that there are all sorts of people who could be great evangelizers for our product beyond the large group partnerships we do (for example with SRS). When I was working with GAF last year they had a lot of regional reps who were excited about Hearth and were looking for ways to roll it out to their customers. I think circumventing the often long and uncertain corporate partnership route and running a guerrilla campaign by targeting regional reps could be a high yielding exercise for us.\\n\\nThe last objective we set up is around “sowing the seeds of long term growth at shogun” and this involves prioritizing efforts around expanding into new verticals, revitalizing AMS’s properties, and setting sales goals around insurance. More on that by the end of this week.\\n\\nWith all of these initiatives in place, this week is about planning out the tactics and making sure that the team stays aligned and informed about what we’re doing, how its going and why we’re doing it.\\n\\nLook out for more on this in your individual teams, I think there is a lot of potential for Q4 to set us up for a rockstar 2020 and all ideas are welcome.\\n\\nOf course, next week is also our 3 year anniversary. I’m looking forward to celebrating the huge milestone in SF this week and in Austin next week.\\n\\nI’m really proud of this company and everything we have accomplished so far. Everytime there is a town hall it always gives me a deep sense of gratitude for everyone dedicating their time and talent to our efforts here at the company, as well as an overwhelming excitement at what we will all accomplish together.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

I’d like to kick it off by echoing Zak’s note in the engineering & product update — happy Memorial Day and thank you to \\xa0all of you who have served yourselves or who have had family that served. On behalf of everyone at the company we appreciate your service and sacrifice.\\n\\nThere was a lot of great work to recognize this week, I’ll run through some highlights and then as promised I’ll share a bit more about the plan for CS as we look forward to welcoming our new VP of Customer Success, Travis Skidmore, in Austin this week.\\n\\nI’ll kick off this week’s highlights with John Marini joining Shogun! John has been an advisor formally and informally to Shogun since about the time that Brandon joined the company in January of 2017. In the early days he helped us rethink our funnel approach on many coassions - he brings a great attitude, energy and a wealth of experience to the company — I’m very excited that this was his first week and looking forward to seeing what he accomplishes while he’s here. John is joining Marketing as Senior Director for Demand Generation. Welcome, John!\\n\\nNo summary of this week could be completed without recognizing the fantastic work in Austin in particular from Partlow and the sales team — 100 deals this week, a company record. Congratulations and thank you to all of you who took it the extra mile to get the team past 100. It’s always nice to see us set high bars and cross them, it pushes the whole company to do better, so thank you for that.\\n\\nA quick note as well on Anthony Vitarelli who managed secure a 50% improvement in our economics with Lighstream — we used to be making 1% of every funded loan but he managed to secure 1.5% with a path to 2% with more volume, this will have a big impact on our revenue per completed application as lighstream is by far our biggest lender. This would have netted us an extra $10,000 last month alone.\\n\\nAnna, Nikhil and Jeff are up to some really exciting things in Product as well this week with the new 0% test rolling out in the coming days. Whats more the product metrics are truly fantastic, as good as one could hope for, its really cool to see how their work has cumulated into a more engaging and dynamic product.\\n\\nZak and the engineering team have some interns beginning to trickle in next week which is always a fun and refreshing addition to the office.\\n\\nAnd then last but certainly not least I want to recognize Jason Mericle for taking on a new product for Shogun — Home Improvement Loan Pros. As you know we bought the company including the product several months ago and now that we’ve increased pricing we think there is an opportunity to sell it to less qualified leads or leads who object after the demo because of the price. Jason is going to start selling AMS plans to a subset of churned or closed lost customers in the coming weeks as a test. Thanks for taking this on Jason, I’m optimistic about the long term success of this strategy.\\n\\nI spent a lot of this week focused on Customer Success, we had a productive and intense 3 hour working session with the entire team this week to go over where we are and some of what we need to accomplish and solve at a high level in the near future. I thought I’d take this opportunity to expound on the subject since its of great importance to our company.\\n\\nLet me start by zooming out and giving an extremely brief summary of why Customer Success is so important beyond just taking pride in our customer base and being the type of company we’d all like to be served by. A contractor is worth on average $860 to us as a company a year, and every loan is worth about $150 (this is going up). If we increase the number of loans we can expect from a contractor on average, then we can dramatically increase the value of our customer base. Training and equipping them for success is the key to our success — this alignment is one of the strengths of our business model (as many of you may remember me saying, particularly in Austin, for a lot of 0% lenders they have perverse incentives where they make most money when customers miss payments). Today we can expect just over 1 loan per customer per year from our existing base, and I think we can get the business to 5 or more over the next several years. My gut tells me we’ll get there by trying many different approaches versus finding a silver bullet. It’ll be a series of iterations, some of which will have step function improvements in engagements as a consequence. We’re making a lot of steady progress across numerous lines of the business (product is already playing out quite clearly), but lest I digress let me talk about CS and some of the developments this week.\\n\\nAs you all know Thursday we announced that we are going to be parting ways with Becky as our Customer Success leader. Becky is great and she had a passion and excitement for our customer that was valued and will be missed. That being said, the set of problems and stage we’re at in CS require a rigorous focus on metrics that comes with experience and a problem solving framework that is more readily cohesive with the rest of the company. Being able to serve our customers in a genuine manner is a key goal for us to deliver on, but being able to do it in an optimized framework while running tests as we do in many other departments is mandatory. We’re still a start up, and sometimes things dont work out for lots of different reasons — the key here is to be straight forward about the truth (our second value) and address situations head on with honesty even if they are difficult. Becky also saw the areas where there was not alignment between Shogun and her goals and we left on really good terms, I thanked her sincerely for taking the bet on Shogun — its something I appreciate a lot and recognize.\\n\\nUltimately we decided to go with someone who has experience problem solving in a manner more consistent with our general approach. That is to say starting by identifying problems and then implementing measurement frameworks — namely metrics and evaluation to prioritize and test against them. Travis joins us from e-relevance where he lead a team there serving a lot of small businesses, some of which were contractors. Travis has a background in math and \\xa0also has experience building and measuring CS in salesforce, meaning that he can spin up measurements on the fly without taking bandwidth away from other departments which will allow us to move more quickly. The biggest problem in CS today is that we dont have a clear measurement for what success looks like for each touchpoint and more importantly we are not actually executing against any measured improvements with the exception of churn. Churn is important, but my strong sense is that we can get a lot more granular with our objectives in a way that drives a lot more long term success for our customers and also makes our CSMs lives easier by giving them visibility into their customer wellbeing (we have a cool project that Zak will roll out over the next 14 or so days to this effect).\\n\\nThere are two high level problems that we need to resolve in order to increase our engagement by an order of magnitude.\\n\\n(1) Principle- Agent Problem\\n\\nThis first one comes down to stakeholder management. There are esssentially three stakeholders to our product — the owner, the admin and the sales rep. Our current strategy is more or less to \\xa0apply the same playbook to \\xa0all of them in terms of the way we interact with/train and message them. One good way of teasing out why this might be a problematic approach would be to analogize it to sea war. If you are on a ship and heading to an unknown coastline you cant approach it the same way if there is a city, another ship or a desert. You’ve got to adapt to the situation and context to get the best outcome, they are all different. Teasing out not only the optimal interactions between the various stakeholders but also what we can elicit from one to maximize the engagement and buy in of the other is key to driving long term success for our business and integration into these businesses.\\n\\n(2) The introduction of uncertainty.\\n\\nThe issue with our product is simple — financial services are “scary” to most people. There is no formal mechanism for educating people about financial services so the variance in familiarly between people is huge. Whats more, most people dont like to talk about things they don’t understand well as it makes them uncomfortable. I try to put myself in the shoes of one of these business owners — its not easy to roll it out to your sales team. Hey Austin, if I told you you could finance the customers that you talk to on the phone and gave you an app would you really introduce it into your sales pitch? I can guarantee not a single person would who hasn’t used it before would without extensive training because — why would you introduce uncertainty into your sales pitch and risk looking unknowneldgeable in front of your customer? You probably wouldn’t. So preparing people for how to sell is critical. That means educating them not only on what they need to know about the financing product but also on how to present financing and deal with objections, the same way you would for any sales process.\\n\\nTo solve these problems, we’re going to need to focus on measuring them. To measure them we need to really start by having a reliable measurement system for our customer touchpoints more broadly — which is one of the reasons why putting our homeowners data in salesforce is a good idea. That way we have all of our touchpoints in one place including success data about usage.\\n\\nI told the entire Customer Success team this earlier this week, but I’ll share it with everyone — I strongly believe Customer Success is where the most leverage for the business exists today. I am not willing to compromise on this strategy under any conditions and even though so far its taken us a while to start really solving big problems, I’m sure this whole path with lead us on the road to having a team that delivers success and education to our customer base in an unprecedented manner. I’m looking forward to that day, and I know that everyone on the CS team shares this view as they have been pushing hard and through a lot of change and turmoil to deliver it day in day out through thick and thin — so we appreciate you for that and we look forward to taking those efforts and putting them into a well defined iterative framework that will help us solve the two aforementioned problems amongst others.\\n\\nThis is the last week of the month, we need a stellar performance to get this over 500k this month, lets go get it!\\n\\nGodspeed everyone,\\n\\nAnthony\\xa0'),\n",

       "  \"Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, August 27, 2017 1:12:39 PM GMT-07:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nHey Team,\\xa0\\n\\nLots of learning this week with the launch of the deep integration. We dont have definitive information that is statistically significant in terms of whether its out-performing out click out flow, but right now we're at just under 5% conversion from clicking the CTA on buildzoom through deep integration versus just under 3% conversion on the click out. Its early, and there is a lot we can do to optimize the landing page on buildzoom as well as the conversion of the core application funnel itself, but im glad there is some progress.\\n\\nI spent a lot of this week reflecting on what we'd need to do to get to a point where we could convincingly argue that we have product market fit to future investors. Before I share how that has perhaps changed our goals somewhat - I want to speak to whether or not I think we have product market fit.\\n\\nThe short answer is not yet. But its not all bleak. I dont think we've got the product part of product market fit yet, but I know that we have massively zero'ed in on the market part with a lot more nuance than we had even a month or two ago. I've spoken now to dozens of people who have emergency, time sensitive, remodels and need access to capital in order to fix their homes. These people are often seriously worried about their ability to find financing for their projects, and really appreciate the ease and access that our product gives them. That being said, some of them made convincing arguments that 0% interest credit cards with higher APR's after their first year make more sense -- especially if they are going to pay back the loans within 12-18 months [or at least they plan to]. Moreover, we know that the best sub-verticals within the home improvement industry for the type of loan we're distributing are roofing, siding and HVAC, as well as other non-discretionary renovations/repairs that we're seeing a lot of traffic around. I'm energized by Nikhil's calls to contractors in Florida, as we had a lot of difficulty convincing contractors to even chat with us when we were focused on Utah [and not focused on a particular sub-vertical]. The question then becomes how do we get closer to delivering a meaningfully differentiated product that fits this market need. I think the first thing we can do as low hanging fruit is add credit cards to the platform -- specifically zero interest credit cards that pay per lead versus per closed credit card. Thats what we're working on with Vitarelli.\\xa0 I think once we can nail and grow that market, meaning we can close more loans in this niche, we can add insurance and secured products to grow across needs within the home improvement space.\\n\\nMore broadly though I'm very excited about what we're doing with the dashboard and identity. Before we build anything or ask the engineering team to spend time putting together an MVP, we have a lot of key customer validation work to do. One of the goals for next month, as set forth on the product roadmap, is to give 10 prospective customers detailed dashboards and get their feedback on whether or not they think its useful.\\n\\nFlipping back to the question of what we'd need to show in order to prove to future investors that we have found product market fit, I've nailed it down to three key truths:\\n\\n(1): A growing gross merchandise value (GMV). What I mean by GMV here, is essentially the same thing as qualified leads. I think we've had something like $5m of qualified lead requests in the past couple of months since we launched. When I say growing, I'd like it to be 100% month over month growth until the end of the year averaged out. As a marketplace, that is going to be a key metric for tracking growth on our side. The levers here are (1) quantity and quality of traffic (2) number of lenders on the platform.\\n\\n(2): An improving ability to monetize and attribute these leads. This is pretty obvious -- $1 billion GMV doesnt mean anything if we're not making money on it. So its important for us to be able to prove to investors that we can monetize our growth, especially given that one of the great things about this business model is that we make 2% of every transaction [which is quite good relative to a lot of other marketplaces].This is the biggest known unknown in the business right now. We dont know why we're not capturing some of the value from our product -- is it because rates are too high? is it because there are lots of attribution loopholes that we're completely unaware of? Is it because the home improvement space has longer sales cycles and people are waiting a while? First things first -- we're reaching out to all of our qualified leads and paying them to get on the phone with us to understand their user journeys better as well as understand what they thought of the rates/ whether what we showed them was helpful. Secondly, I'm drawing heavily on my network to get infront of someone who does sales for personal loans. The good thing about this problem is that it has been solved before, so there is no need to invent the wheel in terms of messaging and calling. Thirdly, we are launching a brand new tranactional that we're pretty excited about and think may cause more customers to interact and click through for the post funnel conversion piece of this. If we can get to 15% of monthly GMV closed, paired with 100% month over month growth for the next couple of months, we'll hit our yearly goal of 1m annualized revenue by december.\\n\\n(3) A compelling story around how we're well poised to develop and execute on a compelling consumer first platform for real estate financial services. This is a lot of the work we're doing in terms of building out the platform. If we can ultimately become the software layer through which people procure financial services that tie into the value of their home, we have developed an incredible fly-trap for capturing identity and creating a defensible and meaningful company. At the end of the day, I firmly believe we can build a several hundred million dollar business on just juicing (1) and (2), but this vision here can take us much further than that. This has thus far been going on in the background of the company -- primarily because we're not at the point where it would need engineering or marketing or legal bandwidth. There is still a ton of work to do here to get everyone aligned and bullish about the consumer value being created. But either way, I think if we can get to a fleshed out and demonstrable version of this product, paired with (1) and (2) we'll be in a very strong place for an A.\\n\\nI think we're going into the last month of the quarter with a lot of momentum and I'm really excited about what the rest of the year could hold for us. That doesnt mean there wont be bumps along the way -- there will surely be many -- but I think as long as we can take dissapointments and turn them into learnings, we'll continue to grow stronger, individually, as a team and ultimately as a company -- progress through friction.\\n\\nHope this is a helpful framework for you guys. This is in its earlier stages of development, I just thought it useful to share with everyone. I'm going to be spending some time with Joe mid this week going over the plans in more detail and I'm sure he'll have plenty of thoughts and valuable insights into whether or not this is realistic/reasonable and what tweaks we could make to make this strategy even more compelling. I'll keep everyone in the loop.\\n\\nIn the mean time I hope everyone's enjoying the beautiful weather this sunday afternoon!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

       "  \"Weekly Update\\n\\nMonday, April 30, 2018 7:09:16 AM GMT-07:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nTeam <team@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nHey everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nSorry for the slightly delayed weekly update, was caught up at this event yesterday.\\xa0\\n\\nWe got a lot done this week on many fronts. I want to take this opportunity to zoom out and highlight the major developments from this month.\\xa0\\n\\nAcquisition:\\xa0\\n\\nThe core objective for this quarter is going to be to find scalable and profitable channels for the distribution of our contractor product. To this end, we launched Thumbtack's partnership and are in the process of reorienting our relationship with Buildzoom to focus on contractors vs consumers. The thumbtack process is going well, they represented approximately 10% of our contractors for last month, and their contractors have done 4 loans so far. We are in the early innings of this, and with the new free trail we launched with them we probably wont see much immediate revenue from the partnership, but this could change once the trial periods elapse [targeted for june]. We are also now in conversation with Porch for its managed pros program [where it is the GC for hundreds of customers a day] and its marketplace product [where it has 300k active contractors per year]. We've spoken to a couple of other groups this month including the NRCA, IKO [a supplier] and SRS distribution. SRS is the most promising by far, they have over 40k roofers that they interact with regularly, and are interested in an exclusive program with a quick roll out. We've sent them the proposed contract and aim to hear back from them this week. NRCA has an affinity program [read affiliate] that is not that interesting, but worth moving along to deepen the relationship. There is also the opportunity to advertise through their editorials but it is less interesting. IKO is a roofing supply company, but they seem to be very slow moving and it will likely be a long sales process to get anywhere meaningful. The final channel is Liberty Mutual's repair network. I'm waiting on an intro from them there to see if we can do something interesting. If we can show a successful partnership here, we have intros to All State and Statefarm which we can leverage to do the same with other players.\\n\\nWe've also engaged a couple of new affiliates -- Dmitry, Balance Claims, and Steve. Neither have born much fruit yet, but this may be a good channel down the road as there are several influencers and consultants that interact with thousands of roofers per year.\\n\\nFinally, our attempts at creating referral plans have essentially failed entirely, but this will be an iterative process. My sense is this deserves at least 1 or 2 more shots this quarter, but unfortunately we still have to learn what makes people refer our product. My sense is also that our existing strategy was too complex for the homeowners or the contractors to understand. We should simplify it to make it as easy as possible to refer people.\\xa0\\n\\nWe've seen great growth on the loans side from our contractor network. We're seeing that Stephanie's work is paying off as a lot of the loans we're now getting are coming from contractors that she has trained. I have not seen the latest numbers, but last we checked, it increased the probability of taking action by about 2x. This emphasizes the importance of tracking how many of our contractors are making training calls and making sure that we build a funnel that optimizes their use of this feature.\\xa0\\n\\nAll in all, we struggled a lot with Facebook acquisition, but will hopefully take the lessons in to may which will be another big exploration month for us on the Facebook side. It looks like some of our weekend tests will pay off, but we need to continue to iterate quickly here.\\xa0\\n\\nThe final channel that I think could make sense is Outbound sales. Scott is bringing on a sales team in Austin in part so that he has the bandwidth to create a script and playbook for outbound. The advantage of outbound is that the leads are essentially costless which means that we can potentially scale a sales team profitably there. Unfortunately with our current Costs Per Acquisition [contractor sign up on Facebook] its hard to foresee this happening, so we need to figure out how to get a diverse set of cheaper leads as we attempt to lower the CPA on facebook. To this end, we purchased a list of 5000 contractors from experian last week that we think will be the first set of leads for this months outbound test.\\xa0\\n\\nInstrumentation:\\xa0\\n\\nWe went from having 1 contractor to hundreds in a matter of a couple of months, which presented a huge challenge in terms of instrumenting their engagement and starting to run tests on it. We made a lot of progress on this front his month, firstly by setting up Salesforce which will allow us to track our sales and customer success funnels better and measure their relative effectiveness. We're seeing that selling over the phone works and that customer success moves the engagement needle which is exciting. Now that we have this data being housed and visualized, the key will be to iterate and test in a disciplined way. Same goes for Facebook data.\\n\\nProduct/Eng:\\xa0\\n\\nThis month we saw a big change in the way that product and engineering interact with Nikhil and Zak's new system for mapping out projects. I think we did a great job getting a lot done and giving our individual team members more ownership over their tasks. To this end we cleared up a lot of engineering debt that we'd amassed by virtue of our funnel iterations since launching the contractor flow. Now that we have cleaner data and a single source of truth, it'll be important to continue visualizing the data appropriately. Although there were some things to kink out here, I think everyone involved did a fantastic job and a lot of great work is being done.\\xa0\\n\\nI'm starting to push us all a bit harder on timelines, and this is primarily a function of our ambitious growth goals, which I will address in a later section. I've been impressed with everyone's willingness to push hard, but we've had a couple of cases of exhaustion this month. ITs easy to forget but important to remember that this a marathon and not a sprint.\\xa0\\n\\nRecruiting:\\n\\nThis month we on-boarded two new members of our team, Stephanie and Shea. We also are likely to make an offer to Lyndsay for the marketing role and had one on-site for the product APM role. We brought on two engineering interns and a design intern as well. We're doing a good job brining on top talent, but its become clear that the couple of months of steady state no hiring cost us a bit in terms of creating a referral/recruiting culture. Anthony is doing a great job with recruiting v2, and we're all going to have to put our heads together to figure out how we create an exceptional talent magnet, which is what I believe we'll need in order to take this company to its full potential. I also made another offer to a replacement for Connie who will be starting at the very end of this month.\\xa0\\n\\nGoals/Progress:\\xa0\\n\\nIts a mixed bag here, as on the one hand we've made tremendous progress over the course of the last month, moving a lot of key priorities forward. We knew that this month would be difficult because we'd have to scale facebook which is notoriously unpredictable. That being said, I had aimed for us to get to 60k in revenue for this month, which we did not get close to. We'll end the month at just over 50k, which is 70% higher than last month, but still a bit short of our goal. In order to double next month we're going to have to be really focused and disciplined about our acquisition machine, and I think we have the lessons from this month to do this successfully. Brandon dealt with a lot of pressure and did a great job guiding us to success and thinking critically about what was going on as well as communicating that proactively to us. Thank you for that Brandon, as I've said many times to you, there is no one I would rather have owning this important of a piece of the company's strategy. We'll get there. We have a lot of advantages that I think will yield fruit this month, including the knowledge on how training affects loan volume per contractor, Shea and perhaps one more addition to Scott's team as well as Scott being able to work the phones on Mondays and Fridays without interruption from cross country travel. All this being put together is promising, and I feel confident we can do a lot better than April in May, but it will take a bit of luck to get to 100k in revenue this month. I think, nonetheless, that we can do it. \\n\\nOn another note, we are working towards getting a new office which I think will be refreshing to all involved!\\n\\nClosing thoughts: \\n\\nThere is a lot of work to be done here, we're still at less than 1% of fulfilling the potential of this company. There are still many challenges ahead, and as we get more successful, those challenges will become more and more pronounced. \\xa0I appreciate everyone being proactive about offering solutions and improvements to our internal processes. This is what we need [intentionality, criticism and proactivity] to get to where we want to be. We're absolutely blessed to be able to see this thing start to work, we cant forget that. I have shared this with a couple of you, but I have many friends whos teams worked with them day in day out for years and never saw this type of traction. I am more convinced than ever of our business and its model. We have been given this insane opportunity to build a really valuable and important company, doing so successfully now is up to us. We can get there, together. I know we can. We just need to keep our heads down and stay proactive and constructive. Its a time of great change, but one thing that I've learned over the course of the past year is that every small decision matters. All decisions pay off positively or negatively, one of the consequences of ownership is that no decision goes without consequence, so lets make sure that we're thinking everything through.\\n\\nGodspeed,\\xa0\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman\"),\n",

Its the final push in what has been our strongest quarter so far in terms of growth and product development. I'm really proud of what we've done this quarter. The thing I'm most excited about in the coming couple of weeks is the new flow we had briefly discussed and which David took an initial pass at designing. I think it will be fun to see the product evolve by integrating the data we're getting from House Canary \\xa0+ the credit card offering. Instead of focusing on what I'm excited about this week, I'm going to take this opportunity to share an open questions regarding the planning for the future of the company which I've been thinking about.\\xa0\\n\\nWe've spent a ton of time in recent months focusing on developing growth metrics for the business. Where we settled -- was doubling our QL number while marginally increasing our close rate every month leading up to 15% at the end of the year. The logic behind having this as the goal for the company is two fold: (1) I think we're going to need 1m run rate in order to be in the game for a serious series A, and thus think its the highest ROI thing to do for our shareholders. Investors want to see us execute on the home improvement industry, its going to be a lot harder to get them excited about conceptual opportunities next time we go to market for an institutional round. (2) It'll give us the operational discipline to focus instead of exploring various adjacent opportunities.\\xa0\\n\\nThe counter argument to that is -- we have roughly 2 years of cash in the bank, and are in no rush to hit that 1m run rate goal. If we hit it in June of next year, that will be equally as good as if we hit it in december. The only difference is that if we spend time fleshing out our product, offering, and customer development in the next 3 months [versus focusing on juicing our existing strategy] 1m run rate 6 months from now will also offer a much stronger case for how we get to 2, 3, 4 and 5m run rate.\\xa0\\n\\nMy initial bias is to focus on the middle ground. I want to continue to grow our existing product while testing new features and financial products that will dramatically expand the base we can cater to while monetizing more of our traffic. I think having aggressive growth and reinvention targets simultaneously is healthy and would need to be part of our DNA as a team should we end up building a multi billion dollar business. The question is if both are goals -- which one comes first. This last month we saw growth come first, and that put a lot of other things on the back burner. That being said we are likely on track to make $1000+ this month, which I'm really proud of us a milestone for the business. Obviously there is a long way to go, but that is a key part of it.\\xa0\\n\\nMost of my week this week will be spent in preparation for the board meeting, and planning for Q4. I hope to have a really substantive state of the start up where we focus on what we want to accomplish next quarter.\\xa0\\n\\nAnother key priority for me this week is to work with Nikhil and Shannon on creating our product roadmap for next quarter, and next month.\\xa0\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman\"),\n",

       "  'Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, August 18, 2019 1:53:46 PM GMT-07:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nTeam <team@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nHi Everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nGreat week this week, feels like the company is turning a corner after a couple of particularly rough months. We got to welcome Brenda to our SF team this week which we\\'re really excited about. Brenda is going to bring our programmatic advertising in house which will be a big step in the right direction as we look to scale our marketing efforts. Moreover, we launched the path to 10 UI which I\\'m excited to see play out, I think that paired with some of our systems upgrades in CS is going to have a positive impact on engagement. I tried to touch on engagement in my e-mail last week but I think everything was a bit too abstract to drive home what I was hoping to communicate. So I created some graphs to share where we are and how I think about it. Engagement is a really interesting problem from an organizational perspective, because its the type of thing that requires sustained and coordinated focus to crack. We are all moving in the right direction though, as you\\'ll see in this data.\\n\\nThe first graph I wanted to put here is the % activation of our cohorts in the first three months. The X axis shows the month of the cohort (I.e all the users that joined in a given month) and the Y axis shows what % of those users have funded a loan. Series 1 is activation as of the first month, Series 2 is second month and Series 3 is 3rd month. I only have up to May in terms of mature three month cohorts. The good news is its all going up and to right. A couple of interesting observations though, the first is that there seems to be some seasonality involved here and more importantly it seems that the season that someone joins can have a big effect on how they perform overall. So the best way to look at this graph is probably to compare months to their prior year. As you can see from April-May of last year we had 12% or so of cohorts activated by the second month where as now we\\'re sitting closer to 20% (relatively speaking this is a 75% increase), and that follows for April.\\n\\nAnother interesting graph that I wanted to share shows how our monetization is getting better. This is driven in part by the fact that we renegotiated certain lender contracts but its also driven by increased \"depth\" of use. Meaning that more contractors are using it repeatedly and from month to month. If you look at the total revenue the business generates in the first three months of the cohort, we\\'re making really steady progress. I attribute this to an easier product to use, alignment on the CS team, and of course our renegotiated lender contracts.\\n\\nPretty incredible, this has huge implications for our cash flow and payback period as well as what we can expect from the cohort over time.\\n\\nNow on to what we\\'re doing strategically to improve this. As\\xa0 all of you know a couple of weeks ago we launched mandatory training and we\\'re orienting everyone to download the app. I wanted to show you what first three month activation looks like for the months between March and May for users who have either (a) downloaded the app and been trained or (b) not downloaded the app and not been trained. Remember, activation means the % of users that we acquired that month that have funded at least one loan, the graph shows you how this percent changes by month (age)\\xa0 of the cohort.\\n\\nThis is what our activation looks like without either having been trained or having downloaded the app:\\n\\nAs you can see at most 10.5% of users we acquire in this category have funded a loan in the first 3 months.\\n\\nNow if we get people to download the app and get trained here is what the first three months of activation looks like:\\n\\nSo you can see why we\\'re trying to force everyone to be trained and download the app, because we can see very clearly that taking those actions translates to much higher engagement.\\n\\nOur goal is to get these first three month activation numbers up to 47% from a high of 28%. I\\'m confident we can get there with time and by continuing to follow the data and listen to our customers!\\n\\nHope this was insightful. Let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

       "  \"Weekly E-mail\\n\\nSunday, November 19, 2017 3:59:33 PM GMT-08:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nRecord week this week with BZ making a last inning come back and all other channels picking up. We're also just about at par with last month in terms of closed loans, which puts us on track to double it this month assuming things continue going the way they are. Not to mention we have about 300k of loans pending [approved and in the closing process] on Lendkey and Lending Club alone -- and we're not counting any SoFi loans we may have closed [we are aiming to get the list of closed loans by the end of the month vs pinging the head of product every week]. I really enjoyed David's workshop earlier in the week and the ensuing conversation about calibrating our revenue goals with our product development objectives -- this was an excellent reflection of one of our key unstated values -- identifying problems or area for work, and offering solutions.\\n\\nI was reflecting more on this conversation and I realized that one of the things that is vexing me about the current state of our metrics is that we should in principle be making a lot more money than we are now, and even with conservatives projections, I think that if we continue to focus on the personal loan business for the next five or six months, that will get us to 1m run rate. You may ask how I came to this conclusion. We're currently showing customers rates on about 5-6 million dollars of loans [Aggregated qualified lead applications] a month. This number has been growing at roughly 50% MoM. If we continue on this trend, we're looking at getting to roughly 45 million in qualified leads processed by the beginning of Q2 next year. With this, and a 10% close rate, we're at roughly 1m run rate. Obviously there is no clear path to continuing to increase that number as of now, that being said there was no clear path to continue to increase it 3 months ago. It remains a function of us optimizing our funnel, SEO as a channel growing, us getting better at buildzoom and us bringing on new marketplaces. There is an enormous amount of freedom that comes with having the business generate that much cash, and my view is that if we're within spitting distance of it -- it make sense to continue to walk that road because getting to 1m run rate in 1.5 years from 0 is quite a strong momentum and operational story. If we pair that with a burgeoning and differentiated product offering, then I think we're on track to continue to attract the very highest quality of capital to the business. All of this being said -- we're still far off the mark, and have a lot of work to be done in terms of closing the loans and this last part of the funnel is proving to be the most elusive and unpredictable. The positive side of the story is that even if this takes double the amount of time, we have the bandwidth and resources to develop the rest of the product vision in parallel.\\n\\nThat being said, I'm excited about the fact that we'll have the recommendation flow tested and the home equity dashboard built by the end of the quarter. I think that sets us up for a record year next year, with all the top of the funnel opportunities spinning [Thumbtack, Airbnb, Feldco, Roofr, Realtor, Paintzen] and an increasingly strong credit product [Lendingpoint and Iloan, hopefully Earnest, Enova and Upstart in Q1, as well as secured lenders]. I was reminded of something important this weekend while browsing through twitter -- it was a random tech enthusiast who shared:\\n\\nGreat companies worry about:\\n\\nRecruiting the best people\\n\\nNever running out of money\\n\\nSetting a compelling vision\\n\\nSolving the customer's problem\\n\\nBuilding a sustainable business\\n\\nGreat companies don't worry about:\\n\\nPersonal press\\n\\nAwards\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\n\\n- The exit\\n\\nThe reason I share this is to say that its totally normal and in fact healthy to constantly feel like we have a ton to do before we get where we need to be as a company. This journey is about constantly seeking to improve and accepting the fact that progress comes through friction as well as building a culture and company where friction\\n\\nAnd with that I'll reiterate our goals for the quarter [which we must work on!].\\n\\nThis will be the hardest one to hit at our current pace. If we can not figure out why people are not closing our loans, I unfortunately am not that bullish about us beating this. Any ideas are welcome here, as it seems our incentive did not work the way we wanted it to. Perhaps we should try again with a bigger bounty.\\n\\nClose 100 Loans\\n\\nThis will be the hardest one to hit at our current pace.

This is a big milestone for our business. We still have a bit of time to \"close\" the deal, but the signature of the core acquisition document essentially renders it accomplished. We are purchasing AMS\\'s domains and contractor subscription network. AMS brings us an additional 1,100 contractors as well as double the SEO traffic and will usher in a phase of renegotiating our contracts with\\xa0 our lender partners.The jury is still out, but we are very likely to acquire their outbound sales team in Charleston, and open a South Carolina office as a consequence. My bias with respect to the integration is to take it slow and steady, we should let their business run the way it has been running and growing and integrate it piece-meal. Brandon Perry, the CEO and Founder of AMS will join our board as an observer, so you will all meet him in due time -- he has built the business over a 12 year period and is excited to collaborate with us on making the most of the opportunity we have in front of us. Nikhil and I sat at the same table we started the company from in my kitchen when I signed the final deal late Friday night -- it was a great moment and a strong testament to how far we\\'ve come. We used to look jealously at AMS\\'s SEO back in the day and dream of what we could do with our rigorous testing and measurement if we had the same traffic. We\\'ll find out in short order.\\n\\nLike any week at Shogun that was but one of the many big ways in which we pushed our business forward. The sales team launched Truly, shout to Venman, our new calling software which should increase pick up rates as it allows us to show local numbers when calling leads. We have already seen some early success with it. Our engineering team released v1.7 of our app on time, it contains a number of new features but the main improvements come to our customer details section which is now a lot more coherent and informative. Our marketing team has been crushing it on facebook, in fact one of the issues we have now is that we have so many leads they are hard to handle, affectionately referred to as \"too much winning\". I had a great time this week visiting Dmitry Lpinksy, a known roofing influencer, for our first public interview as Hearth which has gone alright -- I think it he could have cut and structured the content differently but other than that it seems to be getting positive reception. We spun up our new OKR dashboard, which should help us make sure we\\'re aligned and moving the ball forward -- we have a number of new and exciting features coming out that I think will move the needle here, paired with Brandon\\'s truly brilliant work around rethinking engagement and activation and customer support\\'s ability to gain insight into negative user events in real time, I think we\\'re on the right track to make a meaningful impact to our engagement and loan volume this quarter. As far as revenue, we\\'re tracking nicely at $123,000 dollars and almost $1.26m in originated loans, we\\'re on track for our biggest revenue and loan volume month ever which is nice to see. My sense is we\\'ll get a bit further than 200k, but hopefully with some luck we can cross 220-230k this month. Its going to be a choppy couple of months given thanksgiving and the december holidays, so this is our last solid month of the year in my estimation.\\n\\nExcited for the week ahead -- especially moving offices in San Francisco! The new office is going to be great, and I\\'m told it will be all ready to go by Friday!\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

As we all know we set\\nsome pretty ambitious goals this quarter. Amongst our most ambitious was the\\ngoal of continuing to double our top of the funnel qualified lead count every\\nmonth. I’m glad that we hit it this month and optimistic about us doubling it\\nhere with some of the headwinds I foresee from buildzoom. The key will be\\ncreating more predictability around close rates for the qualified leads –\\nsomething we’re still hard at work trying to figure out. That being said I’m\\nvery glad that we finally implemented Brandon’s idea, echoed by our friend at\\nLending Club of determining intent. I think it will be one of a couple of key\\nstrategies that can help us close. Another two are local dialing and scheduling\\ncalls. If we can get our contact rate up we are upping the close rate in the\\nbest case, and in the worst case we’re learning a ton about what is and isn’t working\\nabout our current product.\\n\\nI think it would be a valid question to ask why would we\\nincrease our qualified lead count if we don’t know how to close loans. I will\\nanswer that question in two parts. The first part is very simple – I think that\\nclosing loans is a solved problem that we will learn. I’d rather the company be\\nat a point where we have a growing top of the funnel opportunity that we’ve\\nlearned how to monetize versus trying to figure out how to monetize now at the\\nexpense of our growth. The second point is that I want to be able to hit our\\nannual goal of $85,000 of revenue in December. In order to do this we need to\\nroughly double our qualified lead count until the end of the\\n\\nmonth. This model has a couple of assumptions so I’ve\\nattached it to this e-mail so that you guys can play around with the current\\nassumptions and see where we’d end up. The model makes a couple of things clear\\n– there are three numbers that matter.\\n\\n(1)\\xa0 How\\nmany qualified leads we have\\n\\n(2)\\xa0 How\\nmany qualified leads we close\\n\\n(3)\\xa0 What\\nour blended pay-out is on a set of monthly leads.\\n\\nIts hard to tell exactly what our take rate is right now. My\\nbest guess is around 3%. That is based on the idea that we have roughly 150\\ntotal qualified leads to date [that are legit] and we’ve closed around 3 loans.\\nThe reason I don’t say two percent is that 50 of these leads occurred in the\\nlast 2 weeks, so I’m discounting that somewhat as I think we may not know how\\nthey perform yet. My goal is to get it up to 15% by the end of the year. That\\nmay seem daunting – but in the same time period we took our qualified leads\\nfrom 3 to 100. We can do this.\\n\\nLots of other work going on in the background to get us set\\nup for what the second act would look like here – hint, it includes a platform,\\ninsurance and more credit products. But for the time being I think we should\\nkeep engineering, product and marketing mostly focused on developing and\\ngrowing our existing product. No one is going to give us credit for trying a\\nbunch of interesting things. People will be compelled by our overall vision\\nonce they see us execute this efficiently and in a timely way.\\n\\nI’m looking forward to seeing us put up some of these\\nbuildzoom tests this week as well as start to bring our analytics in line. We\\nstill have a long ways to go is my sense in terms of product stability but its\\ngood that we’re staying positive and learning from our mistakes in this area.\\n\\nAnd alas we’re going to miss scott but I’m excited about\\nwhat we can do with some really sharp interns this winter. I think the\\nengineering team did a phenomenal job mentoring him with a special shout out to\\nZak on that front. The offers page looks great!\\n\\nSee you all next week'),\n",

Congratulations to Christopher on his big promotion! Christopher we're lucky to have you here and we're all grateful to you for continuing to lend us your time and talent ... and memes.\\n\\nI think we'll see an acceleration in terms of revenue generation over the next two weeks. We put in place a lot of new systems that I'm really excited about especially on the customer success side this week. Putting all of the great progress aside this week I want to talk about \\n\\nOne challenge I'm struggling with as the company evolves is maintaining the same culture of problem solving especially as more projects get put in place across the company. I occasionally come across certain projects that are being implemented for their own sake where even the principal on the project doesn't believe that the idea we're implementing is going to work or is good. I also have seen certain approaches to problem solving internally where we put in place a solution to a problem without measuring the results or circling back to see whether or not our solution worked. The worst variant of this, though, that I'm starting to see a more and more of -- is ignoring problems or hiding them. This isnt a big part of our culture, and I think there are some natural dynamics in any company that lead people to conceal problems -- you dont want to seem negative, you dont want to make it seem as though things are not going well, you want to highlight the things that are going well, of which there are many. The issue with this logic is that concealing or ignoring a problem in the short term is much more dangerous and reflects a lot more poorly than addressing it early. When you conceal a problem, the problem doesnt go away, its just obfuscated, and as a consequence it will grow until it becomes so big you cant conceal it anymore and at that point you are responsible for not having addressed it. So if you think it out a couple more steps its a lot worse to hide it than to address it. In fact, addressing it or even identifying it is always a really good thing because thats the expectation. Having had the privilege of being here since this company was just an idea, I probably have an acute sense that the company is essentially just a repeated problem solving process. In fact, the most important part of building and creating value is identifying important and difficult problems and then solving them. That is the reason why I raise the concealment issue as being a big one for us. To be more specific, there is concealing and then there is ignoring. When we encounter a tough problem or something that is not going well, its hard to develop the mental and emotional discipline to address it. This is true in the company as well as in everyday life. Its much much easier to ignore things that are difficult to digest than to address them head on. I found myself getting worked up at times when I came across problems that I felt werent adequately identified or addressed by whoever would intuitively be responsible for doing so and as I was reflecting on why this happens I realized that I have never shared a framework and expectations around problem solving with the entire team.\\n\\nSo I thought .. maybe I should do that. So let me establish a couple of things for starters. The first is that I evaluate everyone based primarily on how good they are at solving problems. Step 1 of solving a problem is identifying it. When I'm sitting down in meetings or checking in on different parts of the company my primary objective is to identify any problems that may be hidden in certain processes or approaches we're taking. So I'm always 100x more impressed with someone who is aware of what the problems are or even two steps ahead in terms of solving or identifying it than someone who seems like they are not aware of key problems/ignoring them. I've gotten the question -- how do I raise problems without seeming negative? The answer is simple: offer a solution. Identifying problems without offering solutions is always very frustrating, especially in a context in which we're all in this together and our collective job is to identify and solve problems. I'm always looking to figure out what the biggest problems people are solving or struggling with are, so that I can lend a hand in getting the resources for or brainstorming the solution. With that I want to offer a problem solving framework -- nothing too sophisticated -- but some general rules I follow when problem solving that I thought might be helpful.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the problem\\n\\nStep 2: Get the data. Its critical that you figure out how a problem manifests itself. Without data its impossible to figure out how big or small of a problem it is, and its also very hard to know whether you've solved it.\\n\\nStep 3: List the levers. I usually make a list of all the different things that could contribute to solving the problem. Make an exhaustive list of what can be done to address and reverse the issue.\\n\\nStep 4: Rank the levers. I prefer to rank the levers by cost and leverage. Cost can be financial but it can also be in terms of time. Leverage means impact -- how much of an impact do I hypothesize this solution will have.\\n\\nStep 5: Start implementing solutions.\\n\\nThis is essentially the iterative process for problem solving. If there is one thing I've learned in the last couple of years going at this is that you need to be able to look at the most difficult problems and approach them systematically without giving up. Moreover, you cant trust your intuitions, you need to equip yourself with a broad tool kit and check your assumptions especially when you're dealing with a very deep or multiple problems.\\n\\nAnother note on step 1 -- identifying a problem in this process is not easy. You need to start by defining the problem such that you can make a determination about whether or not it has been fixed. Defining a problem means breaking it down, for example: engagement is a problem, but first month activation is a much more well defined problem you can test things against.\\n\\nHope you all have a great week! Lets get it!\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

       "  'Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, February 25, 2018 8:54:22 AM GMT-08:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nHi Everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nHere we are folks -- a couple days from the end of the month with our monthly revenue at $8835.09 and on track to do 500 qualified leads with over 35 listed loans. Its been a long road here. I want to take a moment to zoom out and talk about where we are as a company and where we have to go. To start I want to use one of my favorite representations of the experience of starting a company.\\n\\nPaul Graham drew this to describe the stages of a start up. I think despite its simplicity it has extraordinary explanatory power. I see our history here. If I were to superimpose our experience on this graph I\\'d say the \"Tech Crunch of Initiation phase\" was September 27 2016 - March 31st 2017 [the day before we launched the product]. For those of you who were here you remember the \"Wearing off Novelty\" phase very well, I\\'d put that as the subsequent weeks after we got 1 session on our page and had a 100% bounce rate [we ended April with 2 or 3 QLs]. Then here is where it gets complicated, have we just come out of the Trough of Sorrow and are we now in the wiggles of false hope? Or have we braved the Crash of ineptitude and are at the promise land? Totally unclear and I dont think we\\'ll know for a couple months. What we do know is we have the beginnings of something very exciting. If we can acquire lots of contractors we can earn subscription income as well as increase our loan volume. We can achieve LTV CAC ratios that are insane given the money we make on top of contractors that are issuing loans [3 this week woot woot]. This is the most important thing that has happened to us as a company to date. I think its worth dialing into, and thats why a lot of this week will be focused on gearing up for an insane March where to hit our goal of $20k we need to redouble our efforts in terms of contractor acquisition and LTV development [i.e the work Nikhil and Jacob are doing engaging our existing contractors].\\n\\nSo those are some thoughts on where we are -- now lets get to where we\\'re going. I think the bull case for the company is that we 10x the business from here in the next 4 months. That would require growth of at least 100% in revenue every month. This will be a tough and optimistic goal, it would make us one of the fastest growing companies in this peculiar valley. That being said I think that is where our heads should be at if we want to make this work. We have a couple of tricks up our sleeves, but its going to require a grind to get close. Once we\\'re there the question will be how to think about continuing to finance the company given that we\\'ve kept operational costs manageable and have extensive runway [the runway assumptions we\\'ve made predict that we\\'ll have 0 revenue over the course of the next two years, so every dollar we make extends our runway slightly]. More realistically it could take us 6-12 months to 10x our revenue from here, but we should set ambitious goals. We\\'ll review this at the end of the quarter.\\n\\nObviously I would be remiss if I didnt take a moment to congratulate Zak in this note for his promotion from lead engineer to head of engineering. Zak has been an incredible addition to the team, and has shown a strong capacity to learn and develop along with the company. Many of you who work with him know him to be reliable, level headed and honest. And this is exactly what we need to continue to grow the company. The lead role was essentially invented in order to test someone\\'s aptitude for leadership, and zak passed the test with flying colors, turning the engineering team from highly dysfunctional and political into a reliable machine. Although I give Zak a lot of credit for that, I know that he will insist that a lot of it comes down to the individuals on his team. The entire engineering team has done a fantastic job sticking to our timelines and delivering stable work product, as well as adapting to the ever changing and highly unpredictable business needs of the company as we iterate to find solid product market fit. This couldnt have been done without Jakub, John, Christopher and Jacob\\'s stellar work, high quality work ethic and unwillingness to give up in the face of adversity. That being said we have a lot of room to grow and lets continue questioning our assumptions as well as pushing each other to grow and improve across all segments of the company. For those of you who might be wondering -- how does a promotion work at Shogun? Is there any opportunity for me to grow in a context in which I am not being promoted to a managerial position -- my answer is lets talk. I think there is a strong misconception that the way to grow and level up at a company is exclusively to be promoted to a management position. In engineering in particular, managing often means you have a lot less time to develop your core competencies as an engineer. And at Shogun in particular, there is a lot of opportunity for people to own big pieces of the stack and deliver across business functions. Ownership and growth can come in many forms, and I am committed to offering a compelling growth path to everyone at Shogun -- for most of you that was the first thing we discussed in our initial conversations about the company. Moreover, we all know that as the pie grows, there is more opportunity for everyone. If we continue to grow the company at this pace, we will find more ways to give people the opportunity to experience high octane exponential growth [excellent piece on that \\n\\nhere]. We are all stakeholders in this company, if you do not express whatever desires you have as high performers, then we will not be able to adapt the company to accommodate our valuable team members and as a consequence we wont get better at retaining and attracting top talent. So dont be afraid to let your manager or me know where you want to grow, accommodating that is one of the key parts of what we\\'ll have to nail in order to grow.\\n\\nIts been a long road, but we\\'re starting to see the pay off. Lets keep up the energy and great work everyone.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We're in the last stretch here and unfortunately things arent looking great for our 200 qualified lead count goal. We could still make a big come back if we see some of our work on buildzoom pick up this week and next but we're going to need a lot of good things to happen for us to get there. Its looking like we're at 34 10 days into the quarter.\\n\\nVery happy about the way that the 360 degree feedback went at the end of the week -- its great to see everyone investing in each other's growth. Will and I are figuring out the best way to communicate all the feedback to everyone, but that should happen sometime this week.\\n\\nOther big observations -- surprising amount of loan clicks are coming through. I'm not sure exactly why that is, but its a good sign. I'm hopeful that we can hit the 10 sold loans goal by the end of the quarter. I'm really excited for the new loan flow, I think it has the potential to be a game changer and if we can get it up and running quickly it represents exactly the type of low fidelity test we should be constantly running as we question our assumptions and figure out what works. Special shout out to the engineering team who have done a lot of very frustrating and thankless work to make sure that our architecture is set up in a manner that enables us to run these tests -- 0 p(0)'s is a milestone, congrats guys.\\n\\nIts all hands on deck as we go into the last inning here guys!

We\\'re coming off the heels of our best week ever and into the end of the quarter! Congratulations to sales for the monster week -- we had two days above 10k, which was a near first. This week we ended up at around 45k which is a very good sign as we try to reach the 166k goal we set out for ourselves. A lot happened this week that we got into at state of the start up and that will be the subject of future weekly updates, for this one I want to focus on getting us aligned for next quarter. After speaking to mentors and reading about it, I think we should try to apply the Objectives Key Results [OKR] framework to our business. The OKR framework was pretty much invented by Andy Grove over at intuit who is widely regarded as one of the best operators in the history of silicon valley. The idea is that every department and eventually every person has a clear set of objectives and key results that demonstrate the success/failure of that objective that they can be held accountable towards. These OKRs are public knowledge and easily audit-able, they also ensure that everyone is rowing in the same direction. A lot of top companies use this framework -- saya is familiar with it from her days at Google. OKRs are tricky because they are never perfect on the first go, a commitment to this direction implies that we\\'ll engage in an iterative process over the next couple of quarters to figure out how they fit into the culture that we\\'ve built -- I\\'m personally quite optimistic.\\n\\nFor those of you that are new to Shogun this quarter, its worth explaining how we set goals as a company. We generally hold two company wide meetings -- one is focused on setting the \"themes\" for the goals -- so generally we have 3 quarterly goals and our first meeting decides what we want to focus on [Revenue, Engagement, NPS .. etc etc] and then a subsequent meeting is set wherein we decide what metrics we want to use to represent these themes. The OKR model fits fairly well into this framework, and I suggest that we hold two company wide meetings -- the first to settle which Objectives we want to reach, and then the second to define key results that will demonstrate the objective has been accomplished. This gives us all time to be thorough about our suggestions in terms of metrics.\\n\\nTo start, I\\'ve created \\n\\nthis google form which proposes some objectives and invites everyone and anyone to contribute. All of the suggested objectives will be presented in our team meeting [to take place this coming Friday at 10:30am-12pm]. There will be a conference line that anyone from our Austin office is welcome to call in through. The cool thing about objectives is that we dont need to imply metrics by choosing what to focus on. One of the objectives that I\\'ve put in there as a suggestion is \"Make our customers love us\" -- this could have key results like NPS, Churn, Engagement, ROI or any number of things. The form is designed to both get your read on some proposed objectives, show you what type of things can be submitted as objectives and invite you to submit objectives for consideration. Because I want this to be a serious and focused meeting please note that\\n\\nAnother note on the google form above -- these objectives should be company wide objectives. Once we have settled on those we will focus on department specific objectives and key results. It will be up to individual departments whether they want to further add individual OKRs.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We had a lot happen.\\n\\nWhat I’m most happy with from this week is that I think we have seen two big challenges come full circle. This week two critical things happened that I think are important to highlight for what they tell us about our business and culture as a company.\\n\\nThe first is that we had a successful Customer Success <> Product Sync. There were some issues here around how we were communicating across the geographic locations and departments that everybody on both sides recognized. We were able to move it to a constructive place by hearing each other out and implementing solutions that we thought made sense. The result played out this week. I’m really happy to see it and its proof that when we acknowledge problems, approach them in good faith, we can solve them fairly easily. Nothing in the company is given, everything can be revisited.\\n\\nThe second is that we had a couple of very successful inbound <> marketing sync as well. We had a problem here where a lot of the changes that we were making weren’t making sense to those they were affecting —our inbound reps. This problem was fairly clear to me on my first day in Austin. We tried to implement an inbound marketing sync but it didnt go so well. Brandon flew out to Austin and probably worked 17 hours a day putting together all sorts of different graphs, data, models etc to demonstrate and explain why we were doing what we were doing and why. My impression of the meeting this week was very positive, I think we’re getting to a place of strong communication and understanding between the teams. This company and the departments are partners, and that was on display. I was very proud and impressed to see it.\\n\\nIt’s awkward to bring these things up .. right? Because its unusual to publicly recognize a problem. I wouldn’t have necessarily done that in this forum that is to say to an audience broader than the one the problem touches, unless it was demonstrative of two things.\\n\\n(1) It is awkward to talk about problems, but it’s ESSENTIAL. We need to be straight forward about our weaknesses in order to address them. We have a lot of problems we cant control, but those we can we should and we should very deliberately and unapologetically. We want to build a world class business and to do that we need to know and attack everything standing in the way of that.\\n\\n(2) Problems, no matter how seemingly difficult to resolve, have solutions and can usually be solved faster than one would expect. In both these cases, the issues in communication felt like a fundamental break down in a core company process [and need]. But we were able to address both of them very deliberately and systematically and .. might I say ..quickly. I’m really grateful to those of you who played a role in finding those issues and resolving them.\\n\\nOnward and upwards to another quarter.\\n\\nHere’s to the best one yet!\\n\\nHave a great weekend everyone!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We\\nhave a big week ahead with a couple of key milestones – the deep integration\\nlaunch, the insurance test launch and the paintzen pilot.\\n\\nAll of this will help us get more volume into the loan flow and\\nhelp us continue to grow our qualified lead count. I’m a bit curious as to why\\nthis week we’re down by quite a lot on the qualified lead front from buildzoom\\nin particular. I’m confident we’ll see at least a small boost in applications\\nthis week off buildzoom, assuming we launch deep integration + the new states\\non Monday. That being said it would be worth going back and exploring what\\nexactly is going on. For the credit product, I have two key goals. The first on\\nis to aim to grow our total qualified lead count by 2x every month. Which means\\nwe have 10 days or so to try to catch up on the 45 we’d need to meet that\\nnumber for this month [around 100 qualified leads]. The second is to optimize\\nthe end of the funnel and post funnel conversion so that we can start closing a\\nlarger chunk of the leads we’re getting.\\n\\nIn the background, I’m excited to see the first mock-ups of\\nthe dashboard product this week as well as see some customer validation for our\\ninsurance plans. With both of these products I want us to err on the side of\\ngetting in front of customers too much before we build, and focus our\\nengineering resources on optimizing the credit product in the interim.\\n\\nAdditionally, lots of work is going to be done on getting\\nmore partners onto our credit platform this week. We have some great new leads\\nfrom last week that we’re going to try to push forward. And Brandon has some\\ninterviews lined up for a full time version of Rebecca which is exciting --\\ngreat work getting a solid group together, Brandon.\\n\\nAnother key objective for this week is for us to map out\\nsecured products and potentially credit cards. I think the vision of having a\\nconcrete map of people’s financial wellbeing and then directing them, in a data\\ndriven way, to the very best product requires us to have more liquidity on the\\ncredit side. One of our investors got a 5.4% loan from SoFi, but ended up going\\nwith a 0% first year credit card with a 10% APR because he thought he’d be able\\nto pay it off in 12-18 months. Its important to remember that not all credit\\ncards are made equal, and some of them may be better than a personal loan.\\n\\nUnfortunately I do not have any news from the Lenders. This\\nis in part because it seems like we may have a couple of conversions on SoFi\\nbut I’m currently being transferred internally from one point of contact to\\nanother, and given that we’re in the middle of august, things move a little\\nmore slowly than I would like. I’m going to continue to press forward on this\\nto make sure we’re not dropping anything.\\n\\nLots of work to do, but glad to see things are tracking\\nwell.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We've got to drive hard in these last couple of weeks to get to our goal of $20,000 monthly revenue. We're very close but as we've seen this weekend nothing can be taken for granted, things turn on and off and we've got to be nimble enough to adapt and make what we have work. That being said we're still tracking about 3k ahead in terms of getting to 20k.\\n\\nWe're continuing to see really positive signs of product market fit, with the great note that we got at the beginning of the week from the lady whose roof we helped finance to the contractor who by his own accord uploaded an awesome video evangelizing our product to his customers. I'm also encouraged to see that our volumes have not stopped growing despite us completely turning Facebook off this month. Some excellent momentum across a lot of the core aspects of our company. Amidst all of this, I was really impressed with the Nikhil, David and Steph finding the time to proactively map out the engagement flow in more detail as well as flesh out some key ideas like us building an app and what contractor levels could look like. We also closed a couple of new contractor loans which is exciting, figuring out what the triggers are there is going to be a key to make this business grow the way that we want it to. And perhaps most notably we had an exciting new member of our team join us this week -- Scott! Scott is all geared up and ready to kick start our sales org first thing when he gets in from Austin on Monday morning. Special shout out\\xa0 to Zak for crushing the credit card step tweaks in one day on Friday. Not to mention some really great momentum with a couple of potentially game changing business partners coming close to fruition -- lightstream and thumbtack.\\n\\nObviously\\xa0 with the good comes the bad. In start ups as we've collectively learned over the course of the last couple of month there is always a next biggest problem. As we solve one big problem another emerges. We need to be really critical about pulling these problems out to the fore as we map out our strategy and making sure that we're not overemphasizing the positive momentum. A couple of times this week it genuinely felt as though we'd already crossed 20k, but numbers dont lie -- we have not! And if we decide on any type of growth next month, we need to be sure that we're staying as paranoid as possible until the goals have been achieved! I'd say one of our biggest problems, the one that we need to work on and make sure to prioritize next month -- is we have no way of evaluating our engagement. We dont know if its good, although a lot of us have the sense it could be better. And we're going to have to work to identify ways of making it stronger over time. In order to do that we're going to have to bring instrumentation to that entire process, just like any other funnel. Anthony V did a great job sources two excellent CS candidates that are coming in on Monday. We're going to need to dedicate resources to this as at the end of the day we expect this to be our core business. Not to mention that we still have a lot to learn on Facebook. Brandon, being Brandon, spent hours yesterday pouring over our entire funnel and reading up on facebook ad dynamics. We're lucky to have you on our team Brandon! But we're not only going to have to figure out how to manage that channel as Christopher mentioned in SoS, but we're also more importantly going to have to figure out how to scale it without destroying performance. That is the truly tricky part. If we get to 20k this month, that would be great, but at the end of the day the only revenue that truly matters is revenue that is scale-able and which we can control. As long as our predictive ability is not there AND the channels that drive us revenue dont scale [Buildzoom Direct to Consumer right now] then there isnt much we can do with these funnels long term. We need to keep that in mind across the entire company as we decide what to invest our time in.\\n\\nOverall things are looking up! Get some rest before a big week next week! Lots to cover including the affiliate program, the upsell funnel for our existing $30 a month customers, more work to map out how engagement has been working and launching our sales org!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

We're so glad to have you and are looking forward to getting to know you all better and working with you.\\n\\nThis past week I spent some time thinking about the levers for value creation in our business. For the past five months or so we've been laser focused on scaling and a lot of us have been focused on pushing out a ton of new features, content, products, ad campaigns, designs and BD relationships. In the hand to hand combat that is building a company from scratch, its easy to get lost in the battle and forget the war. Everyone has put in truly amazing work, really. All of us have grown incredibly in this period and as a consequence, I believe our company has grown a lot. We cant ever forget that the company is nothing more than the sum of its parts, and the growth we see translated in our metrics is ultimately a function of the growth we have collectively and personally experienced. In any case, I wanted to share how I'm thinking about the business with you all. Traditionally, this framework was captured by the state of the start up categories, but I think there is broad consensus that we may have outpaced that method of looking back on the week's progress\\n\\nI found that the most useful framework to break down the strategic objectives of the company was the LTV:CAC framework. LTV is the Life Time Value of a customers, for our purposes it amounts to the money we can expect to make from a single customer. We look at LTV through the lens of the contractor, so it is effectively a function of how long they pay us subscription revenue and how many loans they do through us. CAC is Customer Aquisition Cost, so this accounts for the total amount of money we spend to acquire a single customer. The rough way to think about it is if LTV:CAC is < 1, then we lose money as a business. If it is 1 then we break even on our marketing, and if its greater than 1 we can expect a profit for our efforts. The goal is obviously to get the LTV:CAC ratio to be as high as humanely possible. So far we've done a very good job at keeping track of this. Traditionally, its incredibly hard to scale a company with positive unit economics. To date, we have done this incredibly well as our acquisition across the board is profitable, even if our LTV assumptions are off on facebook, if you take it across channels, we have a lot of volume that is coming from null, which would more than offset an unprofitable facebook campaign. And then when you add the 13k or so we've generated from loan origination's at virtually 0 acquisition cost, you get healthily into the positive category. Not only is this an achievement, but growing 100% MoM for the last 5 months [on average] while keeping positive unit economics is a hell of a testament to Brandon's rigor and all of our work [as well as the quality of our product]. In any case, when thinking about what we're going to focus on for the next year, I like to situate everything in the context of LTV CAC. So here is my latest framework for thinking about what to prioritize in order to grow while improving our LTV CAC ratio. At a high level it involves priorities that would increase LTV and priorities that would decrease CAC.\\n\\nLTV:\\n\\nMore Loans Per Contractor. Today we make approximately $10 a month per contractor from the overall loan origination\\xa0our contractors are responsible for. As a side note, this is the first month where contractors are our biggest source of loans.\\n\\nThe biggest lever we have in increasing the number of loans per contractor is teaching them how to sell financing. This will be a content challenge and a training challenge. As far as content, we are working on a partnership with Steve Weyl, who founded the largest residential roofing company in the US, to do a video series on how to sell financing. We should also include tips and tricks in our training webinar. We are also pursuing more content on this subject. We should tie engaging in this content with badges and gamification to encourage our contractors to undergo it.\\n\\nThe second biggest lever is ease of use/access. I did not really think about how much easier it would be for contractors to use an app vs our web funnel. If you think about it, the web funnel is a pretty weak consumer experience as lots of contractors could lose access to the url. The app, in my estimation, is going to drive a lot more loan volume as the product will become significantly more accessible to our customers. We need to keep working on building a world class app here, as well as establishing rigorous instrumentation of in app behavior.\\n\\nIncentives/Gamification for loan origination. We need to double down on our gamification strategy, and implement a comprehensive strategy based on badges and other non-monetary rewards. We need to make these contractors feel as though they are growing their business and business acumen by using Hearth -- we are not only providing them with an incredibly comprehensive credit tool, but we're also teaching them to grow their business and making them better business people in the process.\\n\\nRevisit our bottom of the funnel conversion for homeowners and loans. In the process of growing our contractor base, we have lost focus on improving the experience and sale at the bottom of the funnel for the homeowner. To this end, Brandon and I are going to revisit all of our drip campaigns. I believe we also need to have a better understanding of what each of our lenders ask for from customers at the bottom of the funnel, and provide them with comprehensive guides on what next steps look like as well as methods of thinking about their options. We also need to refocus our efforts on selling them other products if the personal loan is not a fit for them, as there is a lot of value left on the table there. Additionally, we should consider using follow up texts to homeowners around the time they stated they wanted the loan to reengage them.\\n\\nTriangulate the highest value contractors. Now that we have data on each contractor and their business, we should start by focusing on making the highest potential contractors successful on our platform. We should be taking the customers that have the highest sales volume and quoting volume, and engage with them on a 1:1 basis in order to get them to use the product. This will require a bit more time and thought, but we should have a solution for the top 10% biggest contractors on our platform and a solution for the rest [i.e personalized training, weekly check ins, etc].\\n\\nMore credit coverage. We are approving just over 70% of customers that come through contractors. We can increase this by adding new lenders to our product.To this end we're working on Enova which should allow us to drop our minimum credit score requirement down to 500. We should be measuring approval rate and close rate by self stated fico so that we can know where to pursue new lender contracts.\\n\\nBetter credit economics. We only made 13k from over 1m of loans this month. We need to get our average take up by renegotiating lender deals. I believe we'd be best positioned to do this with a bit higher volume -- around 5-10m in monthly loans, which I believe we'll get to by the end of the year.\\n\\n3. Insurance. I'm very bullish about the possibility of selling general liability insurance to our contractors. We have all of the infrastructure in place to do this successfully, a BD deal with the largest broker for contractor insurance companies in the country and state licenses in our key markets. Now it is time to do product exploration and execute on an integration. To this end, I have spent some time talking to our customers about insurance, its clear to me that this is a huge opportunity. My goal will be to start quoting contractors on insurance policies this month. My estimate is that we can make anywhere from 300-10,000 dollars per contractor insurance product that we sell.\\n\\n4. Cancellation fee. We need to enforce it. And come up with a plan there.\\n\\n5. Auxiliary services. What are high margin, low time cost solutions we can provide to contractors once they are on our platform. One obvious one is websites, which may be easy to spin up and which we may be able to sell at a high margin. This is worth mapping out.\\n\\nCAC:\\n\\nChannel Partnerships\\n\\nThumbtack: This has gone a bit slower than I would have hoped. This is in part my fault as I think there were higher leverage areas to spend time on, and I could have done a better job developing this relationship. It is also due, in my opinion, to the fact that there arent clear goal posts for what success looks like on their end. This month, the two things I want to accomplish in this channel are: converting a maximum number of the trial members to full year plans and getting a contact list from them with over 100 leads that we can try to call and convert ourselves versus waiting on them to sign contractors up.\\n\\nBuildzoom: The goal for this month will be to establish total clarity on what the path forward looks like. My sense is that there is some ambivalence on their side around dedicating resources to this, and we just need clarity from them. By the end of this month, we should either have a joint contractor acquisition strategy or terminate the relationship for the time being.\\n\\nPorch: They want to do a buildzoom style direct to consumer relationship. I am entertaining this path as it gets our foot in the door all the while being extremely clear that the real value comes in contractor acquisition. My goal is to reorient the relationship to contractor acquisition and gain as many loans as possible in the mean time.\\n\\nMadsky: This is the most exciting partnership from my perspective. Madsky is the managed repair service for Liberty Mutual and could present an enormous opportunity both as a contractor and as a network of contractors. The idea here is to not only offer Hearth financing to all of the customers they interact with, but also acquire a subset of their contractors ourselves. They have over 1000 according to what I've heard.\\n\\nSRS: This is the biggest opportunity we have to date. Unfortunately I have not heard from them recently, but have been actively reaching out. If this comes to fruition, which there is reason to believe, it would be a step function change in our business as we wouldnt have to share contractor acquisition revenue with them under our current deal.\\n\\nHover.io: Profitable contractor acquisition at scale, Anthony has done a great job bringing this in and getting them to move quickly. I hope that we can see a bump from this this month, but even if its next month, this is going to serve as an important channel partnership both in terms of mapping out the best way to execute against channel partnerships and in terms of increasing our contractor base.\\n\\nLicensing Organizations: We have yet to spend any time working with state and local governments that regulate and license general contractors to use them as a channel. I believe that this could be a meaningful channel, especially given that our product is most differentiated for contractors who cant access Greensky or Wells Fargo.\\n\\n2. New Channel\\n\\nDirect Mail could be a big game changer for us as the addresses of these contractors are easily accessible. If we can prove near positive unit economics with this strategy, it could represent an enormous, scalable, and optimize-able channel for contractor acquisition. Brandon sent out the first iteration of our contractor acquisition campaign this week, so the results here will come soon.\\n\\nOutbound Sales: Right now all of our leads are being paid for, the reason that this hasnt been a big concern for us is because the self serve part of our funnel pays for the leads, meaning we're able to send high intent leads to our contractors at effectively no cost. This is amazing but will be difficult to scale to acquiring 1000's of contractors a month. We need to find alternative lead sources for our contractors, and one that is very promising is outbound calling as the leads are free there. We will have to see how many leads we can convert to determine whether we could have a full time sales person sell outbound product without us losing money. Obviously the more good work we do on LTV, the more resources we can dedicate to this new source of customers. Shea being the boss that she is, closed our first outbound lead this week, more to come! Sales is doing an outbound power hour with Angie's List leads, so this is a big test for us. If we can prove profitability on outbound sales, then we could literally scale contractors by hiring more outbound salespeople. This would be an enormous channel to unlock.\\n\\nContent: My sense is that these contractors are desperate for content on how to grow their businesses. For the small business customers we have, most of the buyers and users of the product are also the company owner. They engage with photos, comments, pretty actively. So my sense is that we could provide them with content to grow their business that would attract a lot of customers and that we could use to develop a lower intent funnel nurturing strategy that could pay long term dividends in the same way that our current SEO strategy has. This includes Quizes, videos, guest speakers, customer stories etc. This is going to be a big priority once Lyndsay joins our team two Mondays from now.\\n\\n3. Trade Shows [Self explanatory]\\n\\n4. Increase Sales Close Rate\\n\\nScript Iteration: We have learned a ton about messaging since we first put together the script. We are going to start trying different strategies towards closing these customers. Right now our close rate is about 10% of the leads we send to sales, which is very strong. We can get even better here is my sense, although like any other iteration game this is going to take a while to pay off. That being said the better our close rate, the more we can pay for leads, and the lower our Customer Acquisition Cost becomes.\\n\\nTracking/CRM: We just got to a place where we have a coherent and optimized CRM for our sales people to use. This is critical as it allows them to do many more calls in a shorter period of time, and hopefully we will see this translate into more closes and more calls. Anything else we can do here to help everyone close is a key priority.\\n\\n5. Self Serve:\\n\\nWe have seen that even after 3 months of iteration there is a lot of lift that we can develop in the self serve category. We need to work on developing as robust and high leverage a self serve funnel as possible, as for the moment and in the short term, this is our most important aquisition channel. So running continual tests here is arguably the highest leverage short term work we can do, although I'm starting to worry that we're dedicating too much bandwidth here and should instead start dedicating more attention to the LTV piece of this puzzle.\\n\\n6. Referrals:\\n\\nHomeowner > Contractors: We have over 10,000 homeowner emails that we should leverage to get them to refer their contractors to us, we should also figure out a way to try to encourage them to refer their contractors when they apply. I think we should start with a post funnel campaign where we send them emails with financial rewards for their contractor signing up and then proceed from there.\\n\\nContractor > Contractor: These referral programs could be an immense source of value for us, as most contractors are parts of bigger networks of contractors. This is something we need to build into our product and reward our existing customers for.\\n\\nHope this is helpful to everyone! Let me know if you think there is anything I missed here. My goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of the levers of growth and improvement for the business, so its of lots of consequence if I'm missing something important!\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

I\\'m excited about where we left the conversation off on Friday, regarding continuing the flow. I think that has the possibility of dramatically increasing our close rate as well as giving us an excuse to develop closer and more helpful relationships to the lenders and our customers. I think that its brilliant, and I\\'m really excited to try it. We have a bunch of other really important things in store this week, with the recommendation engine coming along nicely. The new financing and loans pages look great as well as lots of other bd stuff like thumbtack, homeadvisor, lendpoint, iloan and others. Things are progressing well across all cylinders.\\n\\nIts a huge win for us that we\\'ve managed to accomplish everything we have this month while keeping burn under control relative to previous quarters. I appreciate everyone taking a small hit for this goal, as its really important that we show off how capital efficient we can be to our investors and to future ones.\\n\\nMy mind still finds itself settling on buildzoom frequently. On the one hand there has been tons of progress - we\\'re able to get more qualified leads from buildzoom per month than we were able to get qualified leads across all channels only 2 months ago. That being said, we still need to be thinking about what the global maximum is. My general thought is that lots of this comes down to the landing page where we are losing 91% of people. I appreciate everyone pitching in to help figure this one out. My thought is that the soft offers piece will help substantially. That being said, we\\'ll have to test it to see.\\n\\nOn the closed loans front, we\\'ve got a lot of work to do. We\\'ve closed about $78,600 in loans this month so far, up from $50,099 last month, but we\\'re only making $747 versus $821.98 last month. That being said, we have another $75,000 in \"pending\" loans on Lending Club, and I think we\\'re likely to get the lady who wants $75,000 from Lendkey to close too, so depending on how the next couple days go, we have the potential of massively increasing close rates. That being said, we\\'re still far behind where I\\'d like to be. For us to be in a very strong position going into next year I\\'d like us to be closer to 500k closed loans a month, this will get us to $100k run rate, which is a good starting point for traction.I think this achievable, especially with contractors and all the top of the funnel explorations we\\'ve been making. That being said, I think we\\'ve got to figure out that last bit of the funnel.\\n\\nLooking forward to a strong week!\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

I spent most of my week thinking about the future strategy of the business as well as trying to think through the most efficient mechanisms for addressing engagement in the third quarter. I\\'m really proud of what got done on that front this week, as I think we have a much more sophisticated understanding of the problem set and a more concrete plan towards fixing them. Before I dive into that, I\\'ll maybe spend a bit of time on where I think we are as a business and what our future looks like/how this quarter went.\\n\\nWhen we sat around the table at the end of the last quarter, we had no scale-able acquisition strategy. We were just coming off of the heels of the trade show, where we learned that there was demand for a paid version of our product [which at the time was really a beta], and that in fact the small monthly fee drove better usage than its absence. Nikhil and Jacob had been training contractors on their own initiative, Brandon and I were haphazardly calling contractors from a makeshift crm [google sheet] who came off of our modest facebook campaigns, we were a team of 11 full time. This week our fully operational sales team opened its office in Austin with 7 people [perhaps an 8th customer support person too], we have scaled contractor acquisition from bringing in $22,000 in the month of March to $22,000 a week in June, we have grown origination from that channel from 4 loans in February, to 52 to date in July, we launched an app which has hundreds of users, and we\\'ve grown the topline income of the business from a meager $2400 at the start of Q1, to $54,000 at the start of Q2, and likely over $100,000 next month, the start of Q3 while maintaining *profitable unit economics* [actually, they improved]. Our future has never looked brighter, especially with all of the amazing channel opportunities lined up that promise even more dramatic growth -- Outbound Sales, SRS, Hover, Advantech, Madsky (Liberty Mutual), Buildzoom, Thumbtack, Homeadvisor etc. We have developed high quality instrumentation around our acquisition including Lindsey\\'s fantastic work on LTV:CAC calculations. Now that we have a base of contractors that I expect will soon jump into the thousands thanks to our acquisition engine, and that we\\'re on the cusp of a one million dollar run rate, the questions is where do we go from here. Here is how I think about it: the most leverage for the business right now is in driving more loans through our contractor network -- without that, the business is just a flash in the pan, with that, we have the makings of a fintech giant and an incredibly valuable company. The problem is that engagement is a tricky and very broad subject, so we needed to spend some time thinking about how to operationalize a focus on engagement going into next quarter. Secondly, where are we going in terms of contractor network size and revenue. Essentially, the millisecond that it became obvious that 1m run rate was going to happen in a matter of time, my mind went to work on what a 10m run rate looks like. Its something I think its 100% possible in this industry, and frankly I think it can be achieved before the end of 2019. Assuming we hit only 83,000 this month, that means that over the 5 periods since end of January [where we made 2400 dollars] we have averaged a 103% growth rate. If we grow an average of 13% consistently over the course of the next 18 months, we will hit $830,000 a month by end of 2019, a 10m run rate. On face value this seems easy, especially given what we\\'ve done, but in reality we\\'re seeing that growth decelerates massively as numbers get bigger, and every point is hard fought. That being said, 13% is certainly possible with hard work, smart strategy and good execution, in fact if we can keep up a 20% growth rate for only 12 months, we get there. I actually believe we can achieve a 25% growth rate at least for the subsequent three months, but let me not get side tracked, as that will be a big part of what we discuss next week. In short, our strategy needs to account for topline revenue growth, and a big piece of that will have to come from us driving engagement.\\n\\nSo what does it mean to drive engagement? Its an extremely broad question. I tried to break it down by answering four questions:\\n\\n1) What are the different user engagement problems/stages?\\n\\n2) What data will we need to address this problem?\\n\\n3) What levers do we have to affect user behavior?\\n\\n4) What is the ideal end state for our users?\\n\\nThe answers to these questions are laid out below, I\\'d encourage all of you to take a look at them. We spent a good amount of our time this week kicking the tires on numbers (1) and (2) and what we found was that the biggest opportunity for us was to move as many of our users out of the \"inactive\" stage, which is the stage where they have no completes, to the \"referring\" stage, where they have at least 1 complete. Turns out the difference in the average LTV of a user who is inactive versus the average LTV of a user who is active is around $453.67 for the former versus $806.94 for the latter over a two year period [including churn]. In other words we can increase the value of every user on our platform by 77% by just having them do one complete. There is a lot more to it than just that, and frankly this calculation is far from scientific [in the sense that it has many assumptions] but it is nonetheless very demonstrative and direction-ally correct in my opinion. Now that we can segment our users and have found the specific engagement triggers (i.e training people who have never offered financing before) that create the most lift, we need to employ the levers we laid out to address those issues. Thanks to Nikhil\\'s amazing data ninja work, we have a much more concrete understanding of what in particular moves the needle on inactive users as well as how many there are in each stage. I feel confident today that we have to the tools and knowledge to drive incredible growth in the business through engagement and that should be the core focus for Q3. Q3 should be for engagement what Q2 was for acquisition.\\n\\nUser Stages\\n\\nInactive [No completes]\\n\\nReferring [At least one complete]\\n\\nQualifying [At least 1 qualified lead]\\n\\nApplying [At least 1 click]\\n\\nListed [At least 1 Listed]\\n\\nClosing [At least 1 closed loan]\\n\\nEngaged [At least 3 customers received loans]\\n\\nWhat do we need to know [You can find most of this here]\\n\\nChurn rate by stage\\n\\nNPS by stage\\n\\n% of current users in each stage\\n\\n# of users that go from stage to stage\\n\\nWhat are we marketing to them at each stage/how effective is the marketing to get them from stage to stage\\n\\nHow long does it take them to get from stage to stage?\\n\\nAverage 1 year value of each stage\\n\\nPayment Plan breakdown from stage to stage\\n\\nLevers to affect behavior\\n\\nEducational Content\\n\\nThe three strategies for closing, as we’ve learned from customers *\\n\\nBefore the sale, qualifying\\n\\nDuring the bid, monthly estimate\\n\\nIn the home, closing the deal\\n\\nAfter the home\\n\\nVideo Content\\n\\nHow to sell financing mini-series/webinar\\n\\nWhy offer financing videos\\n\\nSocial credibility/Success Stories\\n\\nWritten content on 3(a)(ii)1,2,3\\n\\nIn person training seminars\\n\\nGamification\\n\\nProgress badges\\n\\nFinancial Rewards\\n\\nTracking versus peers [competitive]\\n\\nPositive feedback loops [sending direct mail, t-shirt or marketing materials to people who fund loans]\\n\\nNegative feedback loops [calling, writing handwritten notes, or reaching out to people with bad experiences]\\n\\nSwag/marketing material/coupons\\n\\nCommunity\\n\\nFacebook Group\\n\\nTrade Shows happy hours\\n\\nInfluencers\\n\\nContractor of the month\\n\\nAffiliates\\n\\nCustomer Success\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nHigh touch messaging\\n\\nCalling\\n\\nEmailing\\n\\nGoal setting\\n\\nPremium support\\n\\nSeats\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nMetrics\\n\\nEase of use\\n\\nApp\\n\\nAutomation tools\\n\\nDashboard\\n\\nAccessibility\\n\\nNotifications\\n\\nMetrics\\n\\nStats\\n\\nCompetetive stats\\n\\nSales stats\\n\\nWhat needs to be true?\\n\\nTrust that the product is functional\\n\\nThe person in the home/at the sale knows that its available/how it works\\n\\nFeel confident offering it [combatting uncertainty of not knowing rate plans upfront]\\n\\nSee the value of successful use.\\n\\nHope this is helpful food for thought for everyone.

Relatively calm week last week with some big highlights -- Kevin, William and Rachel joining our team! Welcome to all of you, we\\'re very excited to have you and grateful to each of you for lending us your time and talent. Next week our Charleston office will grow when we add the 4th Anthony to our company! Exciting developments there, I\\'m looking forward to being out there this coming \\n\\nFriday\\xa0to help map out next steps in our development on the East Coast and hopefully select an office. Another interesting milestone this week is that we made our first loan through the AMS funnel. We are testing a click out integration, Nikhil has been working around the clock to instrument their website and integrate a couple of key tests, the first of which has started to bear fruit. In other news we launched the latest version of the app that contains notifications, eager to see how that affects retention. It looks like the early data from the new funnel suggests that the retention boost that we saw within the first couple of days is dying down. My sense is that that probably has to do with the amount of text on the individual cards and its worth doing an AB test on them.\\n\\nA couple of other big initiatives in the background were launched this week -- the first and biggest is the launch of our new \"manual\" which outlines our product for all of our customers. The second was a test where we sent half of our customers 100 fliers. We sent them fliers that encourage them to ask their contractor for the link to financing and did not include any co-branding to save costs [we probably saved over $15,000 by not customizing the fliers], it looks like some contractors did not like that but its a good lesson for the future. Excited to figure out how AMS has been sending out fliers as it seems like they\\'ve been able to keep low costs and high customization.\\xa0\\n\\nWe also sent  our customers a prompt for 0% financing and had a couple of hundred customers click through -- curious to see how this matures and turns into revenue over time, my sense is this a very big revenue opportunity for us that we were missing up until now.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0I\\'ve spent most of this weekend mapping out our growth strategy and I\\'m increasingly convinced that we can far outperform even our most optimistic assumptions by realigning our strategy and focusing on big growth opportunities. I\\'m going to spend some more time mapping this out before getting everyones feedback, but I\\'m very excited about whats possible next year. Its going to be another break out year for us.\\xa0\\n\\nThank you in particular to those of you who came into the office \\n\\ntoday\\xa0to help us achieve our goals. We had a relatively slow sales week last week, but the sales team is very much on top of it and implementing new practices and instrumentation that is enabling us to identify areas for improvement much faster. Godspeed to you all!\\n\\nBest,\\xa0\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman'),\n",

I want to send out a weekly e-mail on Sunday that reflects on the last week and shares whats on my mind for the coming week.\\n\\nI'll say more broadly, that I think we are at a turning point for this company. With roughly two months of live data from customers, we're starting to realize the value of the buildzoom channel. Its clear from our learnings that buildzoom's contractor pages are not a check out flow that we can bank on, but are a unique access point to consumers that we can leverage to build a relationship and eventually convert through. In the meantime, I believe the data suggests there is some intent coming off of buildzooms core service request flow that we can further leverage. Here is what I want to do about it this week:\\n\\nUse the traffic to learn about engaging our customers as well as where they are in the procurement stage of their home improvement. Concrete KPI: How many people click through the flow.\\n\\nTest retargeting [re-engaging the customer] using paid ads and see how they react when they come back to our website, with a mind towards eventually continuing to nurture them.\\n\\nTest full quiz flow and discuss data we get back from customers\\n\\nMake the CTA more prominent\\n\\nGet BZ's buy in towards engaging the customer about financing earlier in the funnel. Potentially even implementing the project cost loan calculator we had mocked up.\\n\\nIn the mean time we are testing alternative top of the funnel channels. This week I'm talking to Antonio Gracias who is a major shareholder in Porch and has a very strong relationship to IAC. 8VC apparently also has an in at IAC that we are going to be able to leverage to get in front of the CEO. At the same time, we are launching ad buys on facebook and google thanks to Brandon's great work with Thrive.\\n\\nAmidst all of this I want us to all be thinking about what the platform strategy here is. How do we build a world class product for customers that drive real and tangible value to homes across the country. In order to do this I think we need to start by mapping out whats possible. To this end, I'm excited that the engineering team is focusing on identifying what data sources we can access regarding home, homeownership, and financial services tied to the home. In the meantime the product team is focusing on getting customer panels and in depth customer research so that we understand what real pain points are for customers. Anthony Vitarelli and I are going to start discussing what it means to get up and running with different financial services as well as understand the landscape around giving people financial advice and what that suggests for us as a company.\\n\\nIn the background I'm going to be preparing for our Q2 Board Meeting. This is our 3rd board meeting in the 8 month history of the company. My main priority for Q3 is to identify channel economics for the core loan flow as well as establish a strong set of cultural values and an even stronger company product vision. With the exception of a designer and potentially a growth/marketing hire, I see us as being fully staffed for this phase of the company.\\n\\n--\\n\\nLast week was an interesting one. We lost two great members of our team -- Jared and Andrew, but we also gained two new members John and Scott. Jared and Andrew were great additions to our team and culture and I'm looking forward to staying in touch with them far beyond Shogun. John is a very sharp man and will add a lot to our company in terms of his range of interests, experiences and values. The same goes for Scott. Two very different people, but I'm excited to work with both of them.\\n\\nAdditionally, we launched in three states on top of buildzoom thanks to the legal wizardry of none other than Anthony Vitarelli, supported by his de facto parallegal William James Matthews. Thank you guys for your hard work there. This is going to translate into more top of the funnel on top of buildzoom and as a consequence shorter feedback loops in terms of iterating on the flow to get statistical significance.\\n\\nZach and Jakub did a phenomenal job setting up Airflow and Mantle. Both are going to contribute greatly to our ability to leverage data we get from customers as well as learn from what people are doing on the website.\\n\\nNikhil pushed the loan calculator -- if you havent seen it yet, I'd check it out. I hear there was a lot of support, but the product vision here is palpable. Hopefully we can help people understand the basic tradeoffs of certain financial assets.\\n\\nBrandon has been pushing really hard on PR hacker and Thrive. Most notably we launched retargeting last week which is going to give us a better idea of the type of customer we have as well as what the economics of getting a user from buildzoom all the way to the end of the flow are going to be.\\n\\nWill, amongst many other things, ran a terrific culture meeting and has organized our time with the US patent office which is a big win for us as these intellectual assets can help sustain our products down the road.\\n\\nShannon continues to drive forward on the insurance products, I owe her some introductions! She's also been helping guide our thinking around the new product vision. Shannon, thank you on behalf of the whole team for your help and guidance, we're really excited and grateful to have you around.\\n\\nThanks for a great week guys. Looking forward to seeing everyone bright and early tomorrow morning !\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

I thought the goals meeting went well, and am excited about what OKR’s\\ncan bring our company in terms of alignment. The three objectives we set out to\\nfocus on next quarter ended up being:\\n\\nBe the best at financing for “no-financing” contractors\\n\\nGrow the company on track to hit 10m run rate in 2019\\n\\nBuild a stronger foundation for the company\\n\\n* Note, for those of you who are interested in submitting\\nKR ideas for tomorrow’s discussion please submit them here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGMo-JFPiafGQ6FwE5nAj6giZ69IRF_20hO9KFWLj8zvKvnQ/viewform?usp=sf_link”\\n\\nI think these are all aligned, and that we’ll come out of\\nnext quarter stronger across all of these categories. They’re all of great\\nimportance, and they’re pretty coherent in terms of where we want to go\\nstrategically in the market as well as what we need to accomplish internally in\\norder to continue to capitalize on this opportunity quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nThis coming week is also the week of our two year\\nanniversary! Looking forward to seeing everyone this coming Friday to enjoy and\\ncelebrate this wild journey we’ve been on.\\n\\nWe’re going to need to push hard to get to 166k this month,\\nas we’re currently sitting at 110. This last week was a little slower than\\nusual so we’re going to have to deliver our best week ever if we want to get\\nclose to 166. The sales team is grinding this week to hit that goal. Its all\\nhands on deck.\\n\\nThis coming week our focus is going to be on setting key\\nresults associated with the goals that we’ve set up. Lots of exciting work\\ncoming through as well including invoicing launch and gamification launch. In\\nthe background its my hope that we’re able to close the HomeAdvisor deal as\\nwell as the Buildzoom deal this week.\\n\\nLooking forward to it.\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman'),\n",

I enjoyed our town hall -- thank you everyone for your excellent preparation there. There was also excellent work done around the hackathon, Zak and the engineering team did a fantastic job putting it all together. Excited to see some of what we’ve built start to play a role in the product. This week I’ll focus on 3 things: Insurance, Product, Sales.\\n\\nInsurance:\\n\\nTl;dr: Insurance is progressing well, we’re going to be pushing out a beta in the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nI thought it worthwhile to share why we’re working on insurance, and how it fits into our broader strategy as a company and subsequently where we are with it. The core “insight” of the company is that there is a lot of value to be created and captured by developing digital channels for the distribution of financial products. That sounds like a complex idea but in reality its quite simple. Over the last 10 years we’ve seen a massive shift in consumer behavior around getting financial products. In 2010, for example, less than 1% of unsecured loans [personal loans, what Hearth provides] were originated online. By 2016 this number was close to 5%. The same Morgan stanley report has it going up to 16% by 2020. Technology has made it possible to cut out a lot of the costs associated with loan delivery [logistically] as well as distribution [no more paying for bank branches], and consumers are getting increasingly habituated to transacting online. My personal intuition is that most people will get their loans online 10 years from now. So the question becomes what is the limiting factor for the growth of this industry. My sense is that it is in the ability of online driven loan originators to find customers in a cost effective way. Traditionally, what lenders did was they bought massive lists of homeowner data from the credit bureaus and sent them direct mail in order to solicit them for loans. This is still how the majority of the market works. The issue with that is that it has become commoditized and as such all the lenders have the same playbook and it has become a competition for who has the most brand equity and direct mail efficiency. The other consequence is that the majority of users who convert through that channel are in the market for a personal loan to get credit card refinancing. Lenders prefer to have a customer who is investing in their home [and a homeowner] versus having someone with $10,000 of credit card debt to consolidate. Its a stronger user foundation and my understanding is that the loans perform better when they are going towards home improvement. However, if you look at Lending Club, for example, which is the biggest online lender out there in the personal loans space, 85% of their volume goes to credit card refi and only 5% goes to home improvement. The question is -- why? The answer is because they havent figured out how to scalably acquire home improvement customers. Why is that? Because the channel for these lenders to acquire those customers efficiently has not yet been built. That is what we’re building. The same can be said on the insurance side, except the landscape is a little different. The way that insurance companies currently sell their policies to small business contractors is via another inefficient channel -- retail agents. Retail agents are individuals or small businesses that build personal relationships with a wide variety of small business owners and sell them policies. As you can imagine, there is a lot of cost associated with running a retail agency, and as a consequence the amount of value in an insurance policy that goes to a broker [distributor] is relatively high compared to loans. In insurance, as the broker you’re looking at taking up to 20% of the premium [versus 2% in credit]. Our vision for insurance is to build the digital channel for home improvement contractors and use the advantages of technology based distribution to create a high spread business and a better user experience for the contractor. A note on both of those below.\\n\\nHigh Spread Business:\\n\\nIf the traditional mechanism for distributing insurance relies on retail agents, you can imagine the type of cost that goes into binding a contractor's insurance policy. You’re essentially paying for a traveling salesperson to go around and bind contractors by building personal relationships. As a consequence even though the take rate for a broker [their cut of the premium] is high, the margins are low because there is a lot of cost associated with having an individual person going around and dealing with these customers as well as acquiring them. In our case, we believe that we’ll be able to create sleek and simple technology driven workflows [i.e get people to apply for insurance online, or at least give us their information digitally or by using third party data sets + the information they have already given us as part of getting access to the credit product] that will reduce the logistical costs associated with pricing insurance for contractors. More importantly though, given that we’re already acquiring the user profitably through our credit product, we wont have to pay re acquisition costs for the insurance product, and we’ll have a captive user base of customers to sell to [the term we use for this is cross-selling]. We believe that this will lead to the development of a massive [now 3500 contractors] digital channel through which we can sell insurance and give insurance companies access to as well as a model that requires less cost per insurance policy sold [higher margin for us]. In that case we can take advantage of the fact that the current industry cost structure is founded on a retail agent and as a result the broker take rate is 20% while not having to incur the same cost structure associated with traditional brokerage of insurance and the consequence [at least in theory] will be a high margin business. This is a classic example of innovation driving high profit first mover business models.\\n\\nBetter User Experience for the End Customer\\n\\nThe process for contractors to get and use insurance is very broken today. First of all, the way that you get a quote for insurance is by filling out a piece of paper with a pen and then scanning or faxing or mailing it to your broker. This is the first area we can significantly improve on. The second is that most brokers have perverse incentives because of the way that the model traditionally works and they do not have any motivation to find you the best rate. This is because for the most part there are two mechanisms for the brokerage of insurance -- a captive and a free agent. A captive agent only sells policy from one insurance provider and as such they will sell you a policy from that provider even if there is a better policy out there for you. A free agent traditionally has quotas with different providers and may sell you a sub optimal policy as a means to satisfying their quote and keeping a good relationship with a given insurance company. Our vision is to bring transparency and optionality to the process of insurance brokerage, by partnering with a large number of carriers and making their policies available to our contractors digitally and giving them simple tools and advice on how to compare them. The final part of the insurance *procurement* process that I think we can significantly improve on is payment. I’ve spoken to contractors who are still mailing their insurance premium checks in to their brokers. We can very easily create a payment mechanism that is far more convenient and cost effective for our contractors. On top of that there are all sorts of really cool tools that we can build in order to give our contractors an edge -- including providing them with analytics as to how much their competitors are paying for insurance versus them and showing them how they can save money. Another idea is to make the whole process of figuring out what your insurance policy covers much simpler by using strong and simple design to make a policy easy to read [there are a lot of technologies out there that are designed to parse policies in real time that we can leverage]. A final idea on this note is to make the process of getting access to a certificate of insurance much easier. As many of you may know already, one needs a certificate of insurance in order to get started on a job in most cases. The way this works today is that the broker will send a mail with a certificate for every job that a contractor pursues. You can imagine a world in which we can just show the certificate of insurance on the ipad with the click of a button, and save everyone several days in this process. So there is a lot of low hanging fruit in insurance in terms of the concrete workflow that we firmly believe technology can massively improve and make more efficient.\\n\\n..\\xa0 So where are we with all of this?\\n\\nIn January we brought Kelly Troy on to run our insurance project as our VP of insurance solutions. Insurance has been a key part of the strategy since the inception of the company, it features prominently in my first deck dating back to September of 2016! In 2017 Anthony V and I put together a subsidiary of the company that could bind insurance policies and started exploring ways of getting that business up and running. We had a lot of trouble finding the right person to run that strategy until we met Kelly. What Kelly has been doing for the last couple of months has been setting us up with insurance companies as well as building the foundations to start writing insurance a broker. Over the last month or so he’s made significant progress as far as bringing insurance companies on board and we’re now ready to start selling policy as soon as March 15th. We have a wide selection of insurance partners that can write business for us. We’re going to start by using the old fashion call and sell method with the goal of selling 1 policy by the end of the quarter. The idea here is more about mapping out the end to end process of selling a policy versus making money. The reason this is the case is because we want to start to understand which parts of the insurance procurement process we can digitize and fold into our core product. In tandem, and in preparation for a much larger sales and marketing push, we’re starting to ask our contractors whether or not they are interested in learning more about our insurance offerings upon sign up. I believe Brandon and marketing launched this this week, so that when we’re ready to push out a digital insurance product we have a list of our customers who are interested in learning more. In the absence of having an automated way of prompting our users about insurance, we’re doing a set of e-mail blasts that will offer a consulting session with Kelly on what people are currently using for insurance. He will use this trigger as an opportunity to sell customers our insurance. That e-mail blast should go out this coming week. The goal will be to have this become a core part of our business by q3 or q4 of this year.\\n\\nProduct\\n\\nTl;dr: We tried a new product process, the results are promising and we’re looking to launch that before the end of this quarter.\\n\\nAs you all know Anna and Nikhil have been working tirelessly on the new design and flow for our core app. As a company, we have traditionally taken a iterative process \\xa0towards product development. There are all sorts of reasons why thats the case, but culturally and operationally it resulted in a dynamic where we were pushing out new features every week to see what stuck. The end result was a clunky and difficult to use product [which is our current state]. I believe this is meaningfully suppressing our engagement numbers as well as taking up CS bandwidth by making the training calls about feature walk throughs versus selling in the home. This time, we took a radically different approach to redesigning the app. Instead of hypothesis testing -- which lends itself well to a transactional product like the loan flow -- we took a customer centric approach. Over the last 3 months or so, Anna and Nikhil have been meeting actively with contractors, working with Sales, CS and marketing, in order to get real and core feedback on how people want to use our product. Following that they’ve designed a totally new product flow that will be launched in the next couple of weeks. Although we’re still in the process of putting the finishing touches on the wording, this new flow will be much simpler and more intuitive for our users. I think this has the potential to be a meaningful turning point in our business, and at the very least an extremely valuable lesson both internally and in terms of the market dynamics in how to go about building product for our customer. Please look out for more emails about this as we intend to get everyone up to speed on how the new product works before launching it.\\n\\nSales\\n\\nTl;dr: We know the challenges, the solutions are coming.\\n\\nAt the very beginning of the quarter some people asked me what the biggest challenge would be for us to achieve our growth goals this quarter. My answer was simple -- scaling the sales team will make or break our growth numbers. Scaling a team is not an easy process, the amount of time, reflection and trial and error that goes into it is significant. Moreover, its always hard to tell what will break before the fact, so we have to take a reactive and analytical approach to solving problems where we see them. There is also a lot involved -- hiring, HR, management, training etc. Its a lot easier to deal with scaling a team from 4-8 than from 8 to 30 which is where we currently are. We have achieved step 1 of solving this problem which is “get the data”. Thanks to the great work of the Sales Ops team, we now have extremely useful and granular data on sales performance. This has a lot of really positive side effects -- first of all it helps us understand where we can improve as a team. And more importantly it helps managers be specific and precise in their feedback and coaching. What we are lacking at the moment is a rock solid and proven sales training process. We have relied on the resources we have to get everyone up to speed quickly -- and we’ve introduced a lot of improved processes including the product walk through with Nikhil. That being said there is an art and a practice to sales training that sometimes requires us to rely on people externally rather than expecting the current management to have the bandwidth to recruit, manage, train, strategize and perform. As a consequence, Scott brought in a full time sales trainer who is going to start monday [his name is Brian]. Brian has a lot of experience at Yodle where he ran sales training for various different projects. The idea here is that he will take ownership over getting new reps ramped as well as run constant trainings on various parts of the script and funnel to help us make sure everyone has all the tools they need for success. Additionally, we are still honing in on the right ratio between reps and managers for various teams. As a consequence we’ve brought in an external manager, Michael, for his ability to recruit new folks as well as bring best practices and a track record of success to our team. Many of you have worked with him before, and he comes very highly recommended. This does not close off the opportunity to grow into a manager at Hearth, especially because we intend to massively grow the sales team even from where we are now, so we’re going to constantly be needing new managers. Scott and I have been in discussions with Michael for a while and we always thought he would be a great leader in our company - so we’re excited to welcome him in the next couple of weeks. Other key projects we’re working on include implementing cadencing, streamlining our use if Unicor, and monetizing our old inbound leads that do not get touched by our current team. I’m looking forward to being in Austin this week to catch up with everyone as well as see the new office! There is a lot going on here, so please expect a bunch of updates on it soon.\\n\\nThats all from me today folks, there are a lot of other topics I’d love to touch on but I assume this e-mail is already too long to expect most people to read. I’m glad to be back and really excited to dive in and help drive towards our ambitious goals for the year.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Its been an incredible journey, and its exhilarating to know that we’re not even at the beginning. We’re still at less than 1% of where we could be as a business, but we’re getting clear signal that there is something here. Before I dive into that I have to give a special shout out to Scott for being such an effective leader and recruiter for our Austin office. Scott joined us in March [only 5 months ago] and started making calls out of elevator room believe it or not, developing the script iteratively and driving the tripling of our business between February and March, fast forward 5 months and we have a fully functional 10 person sales team in Austin that added around $200,000 in new annual recurring revenue [ARR] this *month*. My favorite part of this story is that we all know he did the whole thing with his characteristic positive energy and a smile on his face. Thank you Scott and Sales, you guys crushed it, we’re rooting for you.\\n\\nGetting back to business … we have our toughest month ever in front of us. Our goals are to achieve 166k of cash income, top out at 1900+ contractors [we’re hovering at 1200 last I checked] and have 80%+ of our pre-September contractors have at least done 1 complete. As you all know I think the 1900 contractors piece is going to be a big stretch, at this rate we’re on-boarding around 60-70 a week [ as a brief aside, at our old pricing we were on-boarding around 80 a week at our height at the end of June]. This is not a case where I think it is logical to change strategy [for example pricing] in order to hit the goal. I think the other two goals are far more important long term, and although it is possible that we hit something that drives this type of account growth, I think that setting up a more deliberate and repeatable engine for contractor acquisition at iteratively increasing scale is more important for our business long term than hitting this number now. As you all know if you’ve spent 10 minutes in my vicinity over the last month, the real goal we’re marching towards is 10 million dollars of run rate [monthly cash income multiplied by 12] in the second half of 2019. To give you a sense, as of last month we stand at around 1.67m run rate. We ended Q4’ 2017 at a $30,000 run rate, Q1 2018 at a $360,000 run rate, Q2 2018 at a $1.032m run rate and if we hit our goal this quarter Q3 will wrap up at a $2m run rate. I believe we can take this to ten over the next 12 to 16 months. For reference, we’ve grown the business an average of 60% Month over Month [MoM] for the last 8 months, and in order to hit $10m run rate we’re going to need to grow 16% MoM for 12 months or 11% MoM in 16 months. This is hugely possible, we’re going to do it. Brandon and I have been working on a comprehensive acquisition model for where we’re going to get these contractors from and how we’ll achieve it in time.\\n\\nGetting from 140 to 166 is 18% growth, which in and of itself is tough at this scale, but more importantly we have far fewer sales days this month than we did last. August is an incredible month where we have 23 sales days, September is a tough month where we only have 19. So we have to hit 18% growth in ~80% of the time. That works out to actually more than 40% growth in per day revenue, a big target. We have it in us, and we also are adding some more juice to our marketing campaigns as well as sales team in the coming month — we have two new team members joining us this week one for inside sales and one for outbound sales. We have a lot of tailwinds, especially around the bulk of the SRS partnership starting to come through, all of the accumulated $99 recurring revenue that should give us a higher base of Monthly Recurring revenue versus what we’ve had last month and an ever improving sales/marketing strategy as well as engagement technique. We will likely also benefit from the fact that we’ve identified and addressed the issues on our side that led to a low fund rate, so that should bring loan revenue back in some meaningful way. Its going to be an uphill climb, but we’re ready for it!\\n\\nIn other important news, as of this week we’re doing some important work around partnering with HomeAdvisor, the country’s largest online contractor network and more good news this week, thanks to the tireless work of Mr. Vitarelli we have officially been let into the great state of MA.\\n\\nOn the company front, we had a big week with a lot of 1 year celebrations, new members joining soon and of course Will passing us the baton as he starts his new company, Mojo. Will will still be around the office helping out, and I’ve told him he is welcome to use his desk at our SF office to start building, as I’m very proud to have Shogun Alumni starting companies. All great companies are the genesis of many other great companies — Paypal being the most commonly known example, and thats my hope here too. Will was with us from day 1 in my kitchen, and has been so critical to getting us to where we are over the last 2 years. He did an incredible job giving us advance notice of his departure [as I joke, he gave me 7 months notice] and we had a great time brainstorming his idea for a new company. Will thank you for everything you’ve done here… see you tuesday at the office! Like everyone who parts ways with Shogun, Will will always be a part of our team and around.\\n\\nSorry for the long[er] update this week, its been a wild month and as the company grows there is more to say. I haven’t even had the chance to touch on a lot of the other critical work that is being done and that will be done this month. I shall leave those to future updates, and in the mean time hope you’re all making the most of labor day because we have a tough fight in front of us!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Unfortunately it seems that some natural variability played to our disfavor and we are some risk of falling short of May this month without stellar performance across the board. On the outbound side we’re going to need to see those pipelines come through in a big way, and for those of you who have been receiving recycled inbound its time to start getting some decisions on board. We’re playing with idea of launching a coupon of some sort to help you all get these folks closed, but we’re really going to need all hands on deck to make sure that we dont have a surprise at the end of the month.\\n\\nA lot happened last week — some very interesting discussions took place regarding the path forward for the company. While everything is still not ironed out for q3, we set up some important frameworks for thinking about what type of company we want to build. As many of you know, I spent most of May talking to investors about putting a round together — My hope was to sell about 17-18% of the company for $20m valuing the company at over 100m USD. While everyone acknowledge that our growth is best in class and that we have a big market opportunity ahead of us with a strong team — The sticking point I ran into in my first couple of conversations with top firms was that they did not know how to value the company without knowing what the churn would look like for our new upfront payment plans. What does that mean? If you think about the historical revenue of the company, most of it was earned in the last 6 months since we shifted to an upfront paid annual plan. For an investor, if 80% of those plans renew the company is worth X and if 20% of them renew then the company is worth Y. This is especially true in a context where the majority of our revenue is earned through up front payment plans. This was a really good market signal to refocus us on engagement and churn, and make sure that we’re doing everything in our power to get our churn numbers for our December 2018+ cohorts to be as strong as possible. Assuming there is no dramatic surprise there [i.e 80% or 90% of those customer churn] then we should be good to go for a growth round around then from a top tier Silicon Valley investor. I also learned a lot about how investors at this stage think about the world and about value, which will help us next time we go out, probably some time between March and June of next year. In the mean time we’re thinking through taking some insider capital from our existing investors to make sure we can continue to be expansive while we focus on engagement.\\n\\nFrom the churn data that we do have, what we can tell is that there is a binary behavior — if someone does fund a loan then they are a lot less likely to churn than those that dont fund a loan. The good news is that over the 16 months since we launched the product, our cohorts are getting better and better at funding loans, and there are a lot of reasons for that. What we did last week was break that data down and say “what makes it more likely that contractor funds a loan”. Well it turns out there are a couple of things that are extremely highly correlated to funding behavior — the three key ones were (1) training (2) downloading the app (3) having a banner on their website. As usual the key is to make it as simple and accessible as possible to offer financing. My sense is there is a 10x opportunity fairly quickly in engagement once we get the right data frameworks and tests in place. After looking a this data we’re going to start making training mandatory for new accounts, which is something that product spearheaded the design and iteration on this week, we’re going also going to try to get more and more of each cohort to have downloaded the app and have the banner. This paired with the work that Customer Success is doing on homeowner calling and the incentive realignment that we put in place with respect to CSMs getting credit for customers that funded loans in their first month, should translate into a relatively significant increase in our overall loan activation (defined by at least 1 funded loan). We’re already starting to see some really interesting results from giving CSMs more insight into how their contractor accounts are doing and creating a strong financial incentive to get them to success — Dan Bentz stands out for his focus and creativity on the subject, he has been able to drive a record number of funds for the contractors he trained in May, really impressed with him.\\n\\nZooming out, we’re trying to think about how to fit everything we want to accomplish into a more generalizable framework that we can tackle in Q3. The key thing here is making sure that what we’re doing in one department coheres with other departmental work etc etc. So we spend this week in a room trying to map out a customer journey. What we came up with was the following. The first thing to know is there are three types of customers in our framework (1) Accounts (2) Seats (3) Homeowners. This customer journey is supposed to describe the various value stages for the customer and will allow us to focus certain projects in moving the maximal amount of customers from one stage to the next, where the final stage is generally speaking the one we’re optimizing for.\\n\\n* pardon me if one or two of these terms changed, I’m putting this together from memory as I dont have internet on my flight**\\n\\nEssentially what this will allow us to do is say OK, how do make sure we optimize every one of these stages to get as many of our customers through the funnel as possible. Although this seems very straightforward, its a very simple framework we can use to apply our efforts over the next couple of months and also allowed us to tease out some problems where we didn’t necessarily see them before. For starters, we had never really thought about stage (2)(a), i.e selling the seat. We see that we have a lot of seats that never got set up or started the onboarding process. The reason is because they obviously dont know why they would. So it occurred to us that we need to have some concerted efforts around making sure that we’re actually reselling accounts on the seat level to make sure that we can get a broader subset of our users through the onboarded. Stage (2)(b). At the tail end of the week we started defining what projects we wanted to put in place across the various stages, and we’re going to continue those efforts through this week so that we can have a concrete plan for Q3 and beyond.\\n\\nI am very confident, especially looking at the data, that some rigor and focus here will yield significant results. I am glad that we’re focusing here, and as much as it is not the path I set out for when looking to attract capital, I actually think this is the right path for the business and will result in more long term value creation. I’m also excited that at this stage we’re taking on such a big challenge, because I feel that a lot of the dramatic 0-1 level insights and growth happened at a point in time when the company’s as a bit smaller, but I look forward to driving the next phase of massive growth with all of us on board.\\n\\nWe have a lot of work ahead of us! Lets start the quarter off strong with a good end to June!\\n\\nGodspeed everyone!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

       "  'Fwd: Weekly Update\\n\\nMonday, January 14, 2019 8:15:34 PM GMT-08:00\\n\\nNikhil Pai <nikhil@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nAnthony Vitarelli <vitarelli@shoguninc.com>\\n\\n--------- Forwarded message ----------\\n\\nHi Everyone,\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHere we are folks -- a couple days from the end of the month with our monthly revenue at $8835.09 and on track to do 500 qualified leads with over 35 listed loans. Its been a long road here. I want to take a moment to zoom out and talk about where we are as a company and where we have to go. To start I want to use one of my favorite representations of the experience of starting a company.\\n\\nPaul Graham drew this to describe the stages of a start up. I think despite its simplicity it has extraordinary explanatory power. I see our history here. If I were to superimpose our experience on this graph I\\'d say the \"Tech Crunch of Initiation phase\" was September 27 2016 - March 31st 2017 [the day before we launched the product]. For those of you who were here you remember the \"Wearing off Novelty\" phase very well, I\\'d put that as the subsequent weeks after we got 1 session on our page and had a 100% bounce rate [we ended April with 2 or 3 QLs]. Then here is where it gets complicated, have we just come out of the Trough of Sorrow and are we now in the wiggles of false hope? Or have we braved the Crash of ineptitude and are at the promise land? Totally unclear and I dont think we\\'ll know for a couple months. What we do know is we have the beginnings of something very exciting. If we can acquire lots of contractors we can earn subscription income as well as increase our loan volume. We can achieve LTV CAC ratios that are insane given the money we make on top of contractors that are issuing loans [3 this week woot woot]. This is the most important thing that has happened to us as a company to date. I think its worth dialing into, and thats why a lot of this week will be focused on gearing up for an insane March where to hit our goal of $20k we need to redouble our efforts in terms of contractor acquisition and LTV development [i.e the work Nikhil and Jacob are doing engaging our existing contractors].\\n\\nSo those are some thoughts on where we are -- now lets get to where we\\'re going. I think the bull case for the company is that we 10x the business from here in the next 4 months. That would require growth of at least 100% in revenue every month. This will be a tough and optimistic goal, it would make us one of the fastest growing companies in this peculiar valley. That being said I think that is where our heads should be at if we want to make this work. We have a couple of tricks up our sleeves, but its going to require a grind to get close. Once we\\'re there the question will be how to think about continuing to finance the company given that we\\'ve kept operational costs manageable and have extensive runway [the runway assumptions we\\'ve made predict that we\\'ll have 0 revenue over the course of the next two years, so every dollar we make extends our runway slightly]. More realistically it could take us 6-12 months to 10x our revenue from here, but we should set ambitious goals. We\\'ll review this at the end of the quarter.\\n\\nObviously I would be remiss if I didnt take a moment to congratulate Zak in this note for his promotion from lead engineer to head of engineering. Zak has been an incredible addition to the team, and has shown a strong capacity to learn and develop along with the company. Many of you who work with him know him to be reliable, level headed and honest. And this is exactly what we need to continue to grow the company. The lead role was essentially invented in order to test someone\\'s aptitude for leadership, and zak passed the test with flying colors, turning the engineering team from highly dysfunctional and political into a reliable machine. Although I give Zak a lot of credit for that, I know that he will insist that a lot of it comes down to the individuals on his team. The entire engineering team has done a fantastic job sticking to our timelines and delivering stable work product, as well as adapting to the ever changing and highly unpredictable business needs of the company as we iterate to find solid product market fit. This couldnt have been done without Jakub, John, Christopher and Jacob\\'s stellar work, high quality work ethic and unwillingness to give up in the face of adversity. That being said we have a lot of room to grow and lets continue questioning our assumptions as well as pushing each other to grow and improve across all segments of the company. For those of you who might be wondering -- how does a promotion work at Shogun? Is there any opportunity for me to grow in a context in which I am not being promoted to a managerial position -- my answer is lets talk. I think there is a strong misconception that the way to grow and level up at a company is exclusively to be promoted to a management position. In engineering in particular, managing often means you have a lot less time to develop your core competencies as an engineer. And at Shogun in particular, there is a lot of opportunity for people to own big pieces of the stack and deliver across business functions. Ownership and growth can come in many forms, and I am committed to offering a compelling growth path to everyone at Shogun -- for most of you that was the first thing we discussed in our initial conversations about the company. Moreover, we all know that as the pie grows, there is more opportunity for everyone. If we continue to grow the company at this pace, we will find more ways to give people the opportunity to experience high octane exponential growth [excellent piece on that \\n\\nhere]. We are all stakeholders in this company, if you do not express whatever desires you have as high performers, then we will not be able to adapt the company to accommodate our valuable team members and as a consequence we wont get better at retaining and attracting top talent. So dont be afraid to let your manager or me know where you want to grow, accommodating that is one of the key parts of what we\\'ll have to nail in order to grow.\\n\\nIts been a long road, but we\\'re starting to see the pay off. Lets keep up the energy and great work everyone.\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

It was great to have so many people out there. I have to give particular regonition to Scott for his awesome presentation on the history of the sales team this week. Pretty amazing that one year ago today the sales team was just Scott, Shea and Chuck. You guys have done an amazing job, and Scott in particular has proven to be a tremendous leader and entrepreneur. My favorite thing about working with him is seeing how much heart he puts into what he does, its really fantastic and genuinely heartwarming. I’m really proud to have him as a leader here.\\n\\nOn the CS side we made a lot of progress this week. For those of you who dont know Sondhayni on our engineering team built out a new page on mode that helps CSMs see how their accounts are doing, whether they are funding loans and translates that into real time OTE updating. I think this will help us keep a focus on getting our contractors successful. Really cool example of different parts of the organization working together to level up the whole company. Great work.\\n\\nI also had a great time catching up with everyone at top golf! Despite my extremely poor golf skills, it was fun to see everyone let loose together. Glad to be doing more of that.\\n\\nFor SF by the way we have a big happy hour coming up this thursday — we’re bringing in some friends who are comedians. Feel free to invite some people externally —should be a fun evening [Nikhil created a facebook event].\\n\\nI spent a bit of time this week diving into some engagement data that was really interesting. The good thing about not having focused on it for a while is that there is a ton of opportunity to drive really meaningful improvements. Stay posted for that, I will circle back by the end of the quarter with a more comprehensive plan in coordination with all the department heads. There is really a lot we can do there to double our engagement in a fairly short period of time.\\n\\nLooking forward to being back in San Francisco to start mapping out and planning the third quarter.\\n\\nIn the mean time crossing my fingers for Austin to keep this great pace up as we try and hit over 600k this month for the company. We’re just a bit behind but I know we’ll pick it up in a big way in the last week of the month. No downside to getting a head start this week though!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Hope everyone had the chance to enjoy a relaxing weekend and is gearing up for an exciting forth of July.\\n\\nLast week was a big week for us on many fronts. We're getting a lot of top of the funnel interest from IAC, Realtors.com, Porch, Paintzen and dFree all of which we followed up on and pushed forward last week. At the same time we ran some interesting tests on top of buildzoom including e-mail that are promising. We're mapping out what the next quarter will be as well as honing the sales process - its clear to me that the best time to be reaching out to people about financing is post getting a bid. Or at least thats an angle worth aggressively exploring. At the same time we closed up some outstanding board action items that were hamstringing our licensing process, so we're on track to get the big state filings done this quarter. Shannon did great work getting the conversation going with Hippo -- which is an insurance API -- we could potentially use to distribute the product. At the same time Shannon and I met with someone from SwissRe who is going to share what we're doing with their internal product team [they pitch tech products to their customers, as they reinsure a huge amount of the industry]. I have a call with a producer who can help us get to hartford and zurich and we recently were connected to Liberty Mutual's innovation center via a board member there. So big wins in terms of getting insurers on board. We're also continuing to do the ground work for Avant and Freedom, both of which I see being live this month.\\n\\nOn the marketing side we engaged and SEO firm that focuses on helping us rank for a couple of key words. We're ironing out some issues with the new flow but once we get that up and running we'll be running ads through SEM again which should bring back some traffic at the top of the funnel. Rebeccah's guide is essentially done, it looks really great, I'd encourage you guys to read it through. I'm really excited about it, I think it speaks volumes about the kind of player we want to be in the market. I'm also very happy about the product themes, we've already run into a couple of instances in which that played a key role in our decision making about what to include.\\n\\nIn terms of talent we have very strong candidates. I'm very excited about Jacob Simon and David [designer]. We should get a lot further in terms of understanding where they are this coming week. Jacob will likely be making his decision and David will be coming onsite on friday. Check david's work out here: \\n\\nhey-david.com. We also managed to nail down some of our key objectives for next quarter. Its going to be a fun quarter, and its always fun looking back at what we accomplished and learned.\\n\\nPretty amazing what we can get done in a week. This week will be a bit tranched, but hopefully will be very productive. Dont forget to celebrate America!

We've been straddling two key paths-- one that suggests we should pivot in a new product direction and one that points to buildzoom as the most important short term lever. This week we got very crucial and valuable feedback from the board on that subject -- not only were they actually very pleased with the early data from buildzoom, but they gained conviction that this is an avenue we should continue to experiment with aggressively. I think splitting focus is always hard especially in a context when one thing has not been done correctly yet [its also a failure case for a start up if we chase too many things at the same time].\\n\\nI think the goal here is to make upfront investments in developing a more complete customer profile, through interviews, understanding key pain points while at the same time focusing on measuring and testing through buildzoom. This can and will get confusing as our organization finds the right cadence for both goals. But I think there is still some very low hanging fruit on the buildzoom side that we can leverage -- namely by testing more aggressively through their service request flow [that has a 10% conversion rate off clicks] and is way under optimized. Last week I committed to going over this with them and we made some progress. Hopefully we'll be able to solidify that momentum in our meeting this Tuesday. At the same time we're going to be working on rounding up customers for interviews. For those of you who have not seen Shannon's interview template, its worth a read -- super thorough and thoughtful work.\\n\\nMore broadly I am looking forward to the happy hour this week, its always a good occasion to take stock of where we are and the brilliant community we've built around this company.\\n\\nWe are also welcoming Rebeccah, our first intern, on Monday so be extra nice :) as well as getting Brandon back in action!\\n\\nNikhil is going to DC to defend our patent -- feel free to discuss that strategy with Anthony V, Will or I we're happy to explain why its a smart investment for a company at our stage.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Really exciting week behind\\nus. Thank you to everyone who spent time working and preparing for the\\nconference – this was truly a team effort. Before we headed out there I was\\nreally trying to make sure we weren’t pinning all our hopes on this one\\nconference to prove out the contractor model. Part of this was because I’ve\\nlearned two key lessons in the last year (1) things don’t work out the way you\\nwant them to (2) iteration is key to turning nothing into something.\\n\\nThat being said – the conference was a total success on a\\nnumber of levels. The basic level is that we signed up our first paying\\ncontractors and have made as much money from their subscriptions this month as\\nfrom closing personal loans and we have many more outstanding invoices as well\\nas around 100 hot/warm leads stemming directly from our activity there. For\\nthose of you who weren’t there – there was genuine interest in what we were\\ndoing. For context the conference took place in a gigantic warehouse type room\\nand we were in the far back corner. That being said, we were standing up and\\nmeeting people the entire time. Contractors were interested in what we were\\nbuilding, felt it was compelling and a lot of them had had bad experiences with\\nour competitors. Brandon and Kevin’s no fee’s messaging really struck a chord\\nwith people. For context, we literally made up the pricing the evening before\\nthe event, operating under the assumption that if people pay for the service,\\nthey’ll use it more [and wanting to make some money]. So far we’ve made a bunch\\nof sales – over 1k so far – in just the couple of days since we went out to Louisiana.\\nBefore we go to far into all the specifics and what comes next, I want to step\\nback and speak to the second level on which the conference was a success.\\n\\nWhat makes me most proud is that this conference was flagged\\nto us maybe 1 month ago. In that month we got messaging, a preliminary product,\\nall the logistics, a plan, and a pricing model going and then went full steam\\nahead with this contractor gameplan. The execution was impeccable, it was an\\namazing example of why its so important to have such a positive and\\nconstructive culture as well as brilliant people who are willing to try new\\nthings.\\n\\nBut here is the big question – what does this mean for us\\nand for our strategy? This is going to take some digestion, but at a high level\\nmy belief is that we need to go 100% on signing up contractors onto this paid\\nprogram. Right now we have 100 leads from the conference alone. I saw we beef\\nthat list up in other ways as well [taking contractor emails and using them to\\ncreate an audience on facebook that we market to in a new funnel that tries to\\nconvert them 100% digitally], and go hard on trying to close more one year\\ncontracts by the end of the month. With the 100 warm/hot leads alone, if we can\\nconvert 50% [which I think is optimistic] we’d get very close to our Q1\\nobjective of $20k in a quarter. The thing to know here is that these contractors\\nwant what we have.\\n\\nSo .. have we cracked the puzzle? Absolutely not! There is a\\nton more work to do. This is 10x more valuable if (a) our contractors actually\\noriginate loans for us (b) they renew their subscriptions because they love us.\\nMy bias is we go full frontal on on-boarding/ messaging and marketing this week\\nas well as creating this new funnel to sign them up and get them to pay and\\nthen focus on how to get them using it more/better.\\n\\nAt the same time we have some really positive signals off of\\nthe mortgage funnel, where we made $200 in one day off of buildzoom. I say we\\nrun some more tests there to see what we can improve.\\n\\nOur job here is to strike flint against rock repeatedly\\nuntil we get a spark big enough to find a flame [apologies for the cheesy\\nanalogy here]. Have we made a fire? Not yet. But this spark is definitely the\\nmost interesting one I’ve seen!\\n\\nSee you all tomorrow. Its going to be an intense week, we\\nhave lots to do.\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We signed a pilot agreement with Feldco, went live\\nwith Roofr [and started to generate qualified leads from it], and inked an\\nagreement with our two contractors. Next week will be great as we’re going to\\nlaunch Texas and North Carolina which will hopefully make up somewhat for the\\nlackluster thanksgiving stats.

That being said I maintain the belief that our steady\\nstate is closer to 70 Qualified leads a week. Next month will be difficult because\\nit is punctuated by Christmas and New Years, but I think we can drive home an\\nincredible year with focus and energy.\\n\\nHere are the goals for next month:\\n\\n500 Qualified Leads\\n\\n10% close rate\\n\\nNew Marketplace [Pella, Kohler, Airbnb,\\nThumbtack]\\n\\nMove needle on Realtor [Map out integration] and\\nPaintzen [get them responsive].\\n\\nLaunch Home Equity Dashboard tests, continue to\\ntest the recommendation flow.\\n\\nGenerate 5 qualified leads from Contractors\\n\\nGet to work on Pipeline for Secured Lenders\\n[Contract or KYC stage w/ 2 at least]\\n\\nGet Licensed in the rest of the states we had\\nplanned to get licensed in this year\\n\\nGet insurance e-mails approved\\n\\nPlease\\ndon’t hesitate to let me know if you feel I am missing something.

Please take the opportunity to congratulate him if you get the chance over the next couple of weeks. Zak was one of the first people to join Shogun and since then he has delivered an immense amount of value to us both in terms of his contributions as an engineer but more importantly as a leader and a carrier of our values. I'm looking forward to this next phase of partnership with Zak.\\n\\nIn other big news, we sold our first insurance policy this week! Kelly has achieved an immense milestone for our business. The new policy went to a familiar customer — eco source roofing — and it was for general liability insurance. We bound him on a policy worth 7,000 USD from which we make just under $1,000. This is perhaps one of the most exciting tactical developments in a long while here. Its a true milestone, and Kelly is confident he has more to come this month.\\xa0\\n\\nWe lagged a bit in terms of sales and we're still working on nailing down our processes for cancellations but overall we're addressing all of the key problems in the business. I'm looking forward to spending some time in Austin at the end of the week and catching up with everyone there.

I\\'ll kick it off by shouting out to Chuck\\'s leadership -- as some of you may have seen, he came in on the weekend and closed out some additional sales, really great way to kick off the year.\\n\\nI was grateful to be back in Austin this week where I got the chance to catch up with Sales and Customer Support as well as introduce a new department to our company. Sales seems to be humming along very well, it was fantastic to see some familiar faces as well as welcome new and exciting team members to Shogun. Thank you all for putting all your effort into making this new pricing work, I feel confident in your ability to deliver excellent results this month and in the future. With respect to sales, I\\'m also excited to see Jordan work her magic on our outbound leads where I think we can develop a strong lift through rigorous data analysis. Customer success is humming along, Meredith and the team have done an excellent job breaking down roles and responsibilities and adapting to our new pricing structure and its corresponding customer categories. I was very impressed with all of the initiatives they are taking on, and look forward to continue to develop our ability to deliver excellent service and training to our customers. I dont think I had one single conversation in Austin that did not touch on the office situation. As many of you may know, we currently have CS split into two weworks and Sales jam packed in our old 800 brazos office. We\\'re working on unlocking a new office as we speak. We\\'re close to finalizing a Letter of Intent and we\\'re aiming to get in there as soon as possible. The new office will be around 6000-7000 sq ft, so it will have plenty of room to accommodate our growth plans. Finally, I had the chance to meet with Kelly Troy, an insurance professional that Anthony V found on Linkedin. Before I get into that, I will just say that Anthony really pulled a needle out of a hay stack. About one year ago we started to work on finding someone with a particular skill set in the insurance industry to kick off our insurance plans, Anthony managed to find the perfect candidate. Well done Anthony, I was extremely impressed with your persistence and also end result there. With that, I\\'m excited to inform everyone that we\\'re bringing on Kelly Troy in Austin to be our new Vice President of Insurance Solutions. Insurance has always been a key part of the vision for Shogun, it features heavily in our first investor pitch deck. Actually, at the inception of the company a lot of the early discussions were around whether we should start by focusing on credit or focusing on insurance. We decided [obviously] to pursue credit to start. That being said, in the background we\\'ve been setting up the infrastructure to sell insurance. To that end, I got licensed as an insurance agent and we incorporated a subsidiary of the company called Hearth Home Insurance Solutions that itself is now licensed [thanks to Vitarelli\\'s wizardry] in many states as an insurance agency. We even got an insurance company to start allowing us to issue their policies. The missing piece was someone with knowledge of how to sell insurance, this proved to be a difficult hire for many reasons. The core idea behind our insurance objective is simple -- insurance distribution is very broken. The way that insurance policies are identified and bound are the same today [especially for contractors] as they were 20 or 50 years ago. The distribution is flowed through insurance agents that take 20% commission on the premium. There are all sorts of unhealthy incentives around what policies the agents show you and how your coverage works. Our vision was to build a substantial network of contractors and then afford them enormous transparency and optionality with respect to getting their business insurance. All contractors need insurance especially in states like California. Although we explicitly decided not to pursue other verticals [i.e dentists, funerals, vets] this quarter in order to stay focused, I was so compelled by Kelly Troy that I felt we needed to get him started right away. In the immediate future, he will be working on setting up our agency and slowly binding policies -- this will not affect any existing department [save for Human Resources and Finance] until next quarter. Our plans across departments stay the same, we are just going to be quietly laying the ground work in the background so that we can begin to cross sell in Q2 and Q3 of this year. Our high level plan is to understand the end to end process for binding insurance policies in a non-tech enabled way and then slowly build technology to integrate that offering into our core Hearth app as well as make the customer experience a lot simpler [right now you fax forms, mail checks etc].\\n\\nBack at home in San Francisco, things are running smoothly. All the departments did excellent work putting together their OKRs, excited to roll those out. I had the first chance to dive in with product, engineering and marketing, and it seems that everything is moving along nicely. In particular, we are doing great work stepping back with respect to the product and evaluating everything we\\'ve built. Our ambition is to bring radical simplicity to the entire process of offering financing and we think this will help on many fronts. The part we have missed to date is evaluating the homeowners needs, and in particular how the homeowner thinks about procuring credit when they find themselves in these urgent situations. I\\'m eager to see what we accomplish there over the next quarter, I\\'m optimistic and excited based on what I\\'ve seen so far.\\n\\nOne final note on internal processes. Those of you who have been here for a while have probably heard me repeat this maxim of silicon valley start ups -- \"everything breaks when the company doubles in size\". This is especially true for our internal processes. We kicked off, with Kevin\\'s help and guidance, a reevaluation of all of our internal standing meetings and processes. Its looking like we\\'re going to clean slate and revisit product strategy, state of the start up and other internal meetings. We\\'re replacing state of the start up with a weekly [could be revised to bi-weekly or monthly] \"town hall\" meeting that will take place in the morning SF so that Austin and Charleston can tune in. Instead of our old and fabled agenda, we\\'re going to be adopting a new agenda that looks at the business, our goals, our finances and zooms into one department. We\\'ll wrap it up with a Q&A with the team about the state of the business. The first Town Hall takes place this Friday, so I hope to see everyone there!\\xa0\\n\\nOverall, we\\'re doing very well this early in the year. We\\'re on track for a record month although I think there is a broad sense that the last 10 day period was a bit slower due to the holidays. We\\'re gearing up for an excellent year!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

       "  'Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, September 15, 2019 12:40:14 PM GMT-07:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nTeam <team@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nHi everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nToday\\'s weekly update is going to be longer than usual as I\\'d like to cover a number of topics. I thought that as we move into position for Q4 planning it would be worthwhile to put some thoughts together on where we are, why we got here and where we\\'re going.\\n\\nI\\'m sure by now everyone essentially knows the story of how this business got started and why we\\'re working on what we\\'re working on. That being said, allow me a brief history here. Basically, as I studied both financial services and home improvement, it occurred\\xa0to me that there was an enormous opportunity to build digital\\xa0distribution channels for lenders into new verticals like home improvement. There are three reasons this makes sense: these lenders want to grow and today their only growth channels direct them users who are mainly doing credit card refinancing loans (this is about 85% of lendingclub\\'s volume vs 5% home improvement), secondly the home improvement market and appetite for personal loans is roughly the same as it is for credit card refinancing (35% of people who got a personal loan in the last year said it was for home improvement vs 32% for credit card refinancing), and thirdly there is a lot of inefficiency in the way that homeowners pick how to finance their projects (40% of them finance with credit card which costs the merchant 2% of the job and costs the homeowner on average 3% of APR more than a personal loan). It turned out, of course, that our original intuition about how to scalably acquire home improvement loan customers was incorrect and we could not plug into large marketplaces like homeadvisor or angie\\'s list to gain scalable distribution. As we tried to revisit the problem we stumbled upon a method whereby we could charge contractors to offer financing and that allowed for us to build profitable distribution as well as drive volume through merchants in a win-win-win. We discovered this model in February 2018, and after talking to a lot of friends who had built big companies it became obvious that our most important priority needed to be finding scalable and profitable channels for acquisition as this is usually the determinant of success or failure in any technology company (can you grow profitable with scale). We eventually started advertising and began to find that facebook was an effective way to grow the business. At first our self service funnel was our primary acquisition channel, but Brandon and I used to call leads that didnt convert themselves and found that conversations with them over the phone meant that we could convert a higher portion of the users that were signing up for our services (but at the time not converting in the self-serve flow). After about a month of this we brought on scott who came and turned our impromptu sales discussions into a script, a strategy, found pain and was able to continue to scale our acquisition. This worked out quite well. We built a team around scott - first bringing on chuck and shea -- and eventually many more with a growing office in Austin. Around Q3 of last year, we decided that although facebook was proving a valuable growth channel, we wanted to hedge our bets as these channels have a propensity to tap out and become more expensive with scale -- so we brought on Boone, Drew and Clayton to start driving outbound sales (at the time Shea actually player coached that team!). It turned out that we had a good signal from outbound selling and we decided to invest heavily in this. The way to think about our acquisition at the end of the day is a combination of inbound and outbound sales and those blended economics are what make or break our company. So at this period we focused primarily on growing our existing channels and trying to run as many tests as possible to more efficiently\\xa0 acquire customers. When we entered Q4 last year, there was a consensus view that we needed to spend more time on engagement as that was an additional growth lever for our business and on top of that better engagement means higher value customers which means our acquisition becomes more efficient. So we made a couple of big steps towards understanding and focusing on our customers more, with Anna\\'s leadership in particular we were able to get our product to a place where we could invite even higher engagement and understanding of our product across the board for our customers, this translated to more loans per contractor, a big step up you can see from the moment we introduced our first big App redesign.\\n\\nIn April/May of last year the board was looking at our growth numbers and telling us hey you guys are really crushing it, lets go out and raise a big round. We decided to talk to a couple of people we knew well to see if there was interest in getting a trusted and close top tier fund to lead a big investment into our company. Of the three or four groups I spoke to, the same exact thing came up every time. Basically, they love the business, they are impressed with the growth and the team, but the issue that was blocking us from getting to the next phase of financing was: we had no signal on retention. As you know, in December we moved all of our pricing to annual up front payments. And although this method is very good for our company\\'s internal economics and the pay back periods for our acquisition, it meant that all of the customers we\\'d acquired still offered very little to no signal about whether they would renew, and getting a numerical indication of our retention was not going to happen until the annual upfront payment cohorts at the higher price point (starting in December 2018) would come up for renewal. Since companies are valued on discounted future cash flows, understanding the renewal behavior of our customers, especially in a context where the majority of our revenue comes from subscription payments, is literally \\n\\nSo the reality now is that if we want to continue to grow and scale this business in such a way that attracts venture capital, we need to be able to deliver strong and improving engagement numbers (which is what we\\'re doing) as well as start to get a baseline for churn on our new pricing (which will come naturally in december). The idea here is that by the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2 2019 we can go out to these large institutional investors and raise money while giving them the data and cohort maturity they need to value the company. That is why we\\'re so focused on engagement and retention, its the key to unlocking the next phase of growth for the business. My two cents is that in order to unlock this next phase, we\\'re going to need to demonstrate an ability to improve engagement, understand the relationship between engagement/demographics/acquisition and churn, and demonstrate that we\\'re able to improve churn over time. So even if our december cohort comes back with difficult churn numbers, if we understand how those churn numbers came to be and can show why with improving engagement we expect churn to improve then we\\'re golden. We dont need to have stellar churn numbers out of the gate, but we do need to be able to show we understand it and that with time it will improve such that our cash flows and revenue retention increases. So in this spirit, the key things to focus on are engagement, re-engagement and churn as we go into this next 6-8 month period.\\n\\nNow what does that imply about where and how the business will grow? We\\'ve been focused primarily on cashflow as a business, and we rally around our revenue as a way to measure how our strategy is working out. The reality though is that cash flow is not really the measure of the business\\'s performance or the effectiveness of our strategy. Especially given that there are a number of highly cylical and seasonal inputs like SEO driven revenue from AMS as well as our own direct to consumer properties. The real measure of our core business is ARR (annualized recurring revenue) as this is the largest lever for our future cash flows. And even if our cash flow stays steady, that just means we\\'re stacking recurring revenue. In other words if we can keep making 400k a month from sales adding ARR to our business and increase engagement/retention over time we\\'ll grow the business as a \"Software as a Service\" company (SaaS) and the recurring revenue will stack on top of itself. So even for this quarter, we\\'ll have added around 1.2m in recurring revenue which is a lot higher than any other quarter we\\'ve had. That doesnt mean cashflow doesnt matter, it really does, especially as it relates to \"runway\" which determines how much time we have to get where we need to be and attract more capital. So they are both measuring sticks for different things, but overall the more important one is ARR in the long term. What I\\'m triyng to say here is that even if our cashflows stay constant, our revenues are naturally growing because the revenue recurs\\xa0as a subscription which we\\'re adding on top of itself. By getting better at renewing our customers, we can guarantee that more of the revenue we acquire today contributes to our cashflow tomorrow.\\n\\nNo matter what our cashflow is, we\\'re going to have gone from having around $1m of recurring revenue in 2018 to about $5m in 2019 which is a huge growth. If we say had 100% retention and didnt grow our acquisition at all, that implies that in 2020 we\\'d have $10m recurring revenue and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo thats whats going on in the midterm. But there is a good question which is a bit broader around what we\\'re supposed to be doing after we get past the next level. WE dont want to feel like we\\'re just playing the VC game, we\\'re doing something else here entirely. Nailing this part down has always been difficult for me, because I come from a different mindset then most people in our industry. I hate to invent contrived reasons for businesses when I think that the underlying goal of the business is to create and capture value for the stakeholders in the business. That being said, if there was a trade or investment opportunity that could create and capture value to the same extent as building this company successfully (in other words if you held the value capture/creation constant there is more to this business than just making money). I think there are a number of things that excite me beyond just building a lot of shareholder value.\\n\\nI believe that for the most part if you want to capture value, you have to create it. It follows that the average business can only succeed if it is in fact doing something for someone else that is adding value to their life in some way shape or form.\\n\\nIn our case we\\'re lucky because its very easy to see how we capture and create value. The issue that makes me hesitate as we define our vision, is that we did not enter this business with this particular value creation model in mind, we discovered it by searching for areas to create value.\\n\\nFor the contractors who use our product in its intended way, they are growing their business and winning customers that they wouldnt have been able to do without us. In fact, if they\\'ve used the product just 10 times, they are essentially guaranteed to make 10 times what they paid for it for their business. Contractors, especially small business contractors, have been cut out of focus for most technology companies and with the exception of this one no one had really brought cutting edge financial technology to their fingertips so that they could compete with bigger players that have access to large financial institutions. By democratizing this competitive tool and figuring out how to bring the word of it to the market, we\\'ve enabled contractors to win tens of millions of dollars in new business. That huge, especially in a context where these are not enormous businesses for which an additional 10,20 or 30 thousand dollars doesnt move the needle. This means people have better lives and can grow their businesses.\\n\\nBut this only works if we\\'re able to genuinely serve competitive financial solutions to the homeowners that they work with. As much as I get excited about the prospect of scalably enabling small business growth, I have to say the thing that gets me truly excited is helping homeowners make smart decisions around what products they get. Before financial services could be priced and distributed electronically, people used to operate in a captive system whereby they\\'d essentially only get access to financial services that were immediately available to them. We can see very clearly from our own product that there is a huge amount of inefficiency in dealing with one potential lender versus multiple. For our own customers we see enormous differences in monthly payment and total loan costs for the same customer from different lenders. What that means is that by surfacing multiple lenders we can help them find ones that have risk assessments that are most favorable and ultimately save homeowners money on financing. That being said, we clearly cant deliver that value and competitive edge every single time someone applies (yet). But something amazing is happening in the broader economy thanks to technology, more and more financial services are coming online. This means you can envision a world where any and every product (be it a credit card, a mortgage, a personal loan) can be priced and acquired digitally. Which means that 10 years from now we may well be able to offer homeowners a search functionality around all of the types of credit they are eligible for and give them the efficiency of comparing and procuring the one that is best suited to their complex needs -- all done in a paperless and virtually instant way. I think this would be an amazing impact to have on the country and could drive enormous efficiency, especially because one of the biggest problems and limitations of our society is that we do not educate our people on financial services and as a result they pay the price in the form of inefficient procurement (and higher amount of their paycheck going to financial services than would in an efficient market). We talk a lot about 0% and how no one reads the fine print on it, but the reality is no one reads the fine print on anything and most people are not even aware of what their options are when it comes to credit. We are going to be able to deliver the transparency and accessibility that will allow them to make informed and \\n\\nAnd the way our product and experience matrix is set up, the better we are at getting homeowners financial services they are compelled by, the more successful merchants will be with our product, the more volume we can deliver to our lender partners and the more our business grows overall. The core transaction that drives value across the rest of the chain is in the form of helping homeowners find options that work for them and suit the constraints of the transaction (needing the money quickly etc).\\n\\nAnd given what we understand, our view is that once we become the best in the world and figuring out what financial products people need, we can apply this technology and knowledge to various transactions, to make this point of need financing solution contextually intelligent, accessible and widely available.\\n\\nNow we\\'re at an early stage of this journey because the market has yet to develop distribution mechanisms (i.e APIs for HELOCs etc) that allow for us to price across product categories. In fact, credit card companies dont even have the API technology yet. But the same was true of personal loan products in 2016 when we started the business (most lenders at the time didnt have APIs either) and its clear that there are enormous projects going on in both credit card and home equity line distribution that are going to bring the pricing and underwriting functionality of personal loans to the rest of the market (and ultimately enable us to deliver on this vision of helping borrowers find the right product for them at the right time).\\n\\nOne day, any big purchase you have to make that is unexpected, you\\'re going to be happy to find that in store is a dead simple shogun technology that helps you make the right decisions about how to get past whatever unexpected situation you\\'re in. That day is coming ever closer. If we dont do it, I\\'m 100% sure that someone else will, as this seems to be to be an inevitable development in financial services given whats possible with technology.\\n\\nI know we\\'ll be the ones to do it at the end of the day, because this is the right team to deliver that vision and we have what it takes to move the needle at scale and help hundreds of thousands of businesses as well as millions of people take advantage of whats only very recently become possible thanks to technology.\\n\\nIts easy to lose track of all of this in the hand to hand combat that is building a company from scratch, and there is a lot of noise on our way to where we\\'re going -- but as someone who has been there from day one and seen us go from there to where we are now in three short years, I\\'ve never been more confident that we are on the right path to building a high impact company and also introducing a new model to financial technology that I think has no upper limit in terms of value creation (and capture for that matter).\\n\\nAs we move into the next quarter, lets keep this all in mind and make sure we\\'re focusing our energy where it matters - delivering better outcomes with our products, building the future of financial service distribution together.\\n\\nOur opportunity here is to build the largest financial technology company that the world has ever seen.\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Looks like we’ve got a really strong amount of momentum in Austin across CS and Sales. Really excited about some of the projects that are being put in place in Customer Success especially, where we’re finally starting to get our systems to where we can be running expriments that get real feedback in terms of what works and doesn’t. This is going to be really big for our customers and will enable us to deliver a much better and more consistent experience to our customers. The very best version of this business has us generating billions and billions of dollars in new deals and value for our contractors, really enabling these small businesses to grow and thrive.\\n\\nAs I’ve been meeting with investors and learning more about how they think about the world as well as viewing our company through different lenses they use to evaluate products/businesses, I’m becoming convinced that its time we start to shift our focus to engagement much more rigorously across the company. Over the next couple of weeks as we work to come up with our Q3 plan, I’m going to be open to all ideas on how we can be driving more and more engagement across our entire user base. The truth of the matter is that this is not something I have brought the same amount of focus and rigor to versus things like acquisition where I think we’ve built an incredible and highly functional machine. I’m looking forward to setting ambitious goals here and moving aggressively towards them in the 3rd quarter. As you know we will be sending out a survey for thoughts and feedback on the q3 goals, and I’m looking forward to seeing how many of you also want us to be putting more resources there. Its clear there is a huge amount of opportunity to drive stickiness and value by getting our contractors to do more loans/learn to sell financing.\\n\\nWe’ve made a lot of progress through improvements to our product just in the last couple of months, but there is a lot more opportunity. Travis’ weekly update from CS is a very good start, I’m excited to get us all around the table thinking and working on this piece. My focus for this week is going to be to map this out in more detail.\\n\\nWe made a couple of new hires this week across the company. Engineering and product are both welcoming new members to their team in short order. Looking forward to seeing them succeed here. I’m really pleased to hear everything is going well with the outbound leads this month and impressed with Aaron’s process and early results.\\n\\nA lot of us in SF are going to be in Austin this week — very much looking forward to catching up with everyone there.\\n\\nUntil, then, enjoy the rest of the weekend!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

       "  \"Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, January 7, 2018 12:40:01 PM GMT-08:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nHi everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nExcellent session to top off a solid first week of the year. Thank you all for preparing and engaging in that discussion. As I mentioned last week, one of my big personal lessons last quarter was that I should do a better job getting buy in for our goals across the company. Last quarter was instructive in that we had a lot going on and we were able to reflect on what was and wasnt achieved. My big conclusion there -- as I mentioned -- is that at this stage of the company we benefit tremendously from relentless focus. And to get to the next stage of this company [post series-A] we need to show one thing working really well, or one market that we've really understood. In that spirit, I was glad to get alignment on focusing on revenue and loan growth. That doesnt mean that we've magically figured out how to set goals, it just means that we're going to dedicate this quarter to that objective. At the end of the quarter we'll have learned a lot about how to structure goals and whats possible. We may decide that after this quarter we should focus elsewhere, try a blended focus or continue to grow our revenue numbers.\\n\\nThe goals we set were ambitious -- $20,000 monthly revenue for March, 30 closed loans on marketplaces, and 20 closed loans through contractors. I suggest we break these goals down further and divide them up into monthly objectives. I suggest we set them as follows:\\n\\nJanuary\\n\\nFebruary\\n\\nMarch\\n\\nMarketplaces\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\nSEO\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\nPaid\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nContractors\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n35\\n\\n70\\n\\n100\\n\\nThis is still very preliminary and I'm curious to get people's feedback on what they think is possible. We're 1 week into January and we already have 5 closed loans, 3 from paid and 2 from SEO [this assumes that 1 of our pending LendingClub Loans will close, which I believe because I'm texting the customer as he uploads his paystub].\\n\\nThe key to achieving our goals here will be to streamline the organization such that all of these individual goals are devolved into individualized tasks and objectives. This will be a key project for this coming week, as well as the new evaluation criteria.\\n\\nFor example, at our current conversion rates if we wanted to achieve *this months* goals we would need 833 Qualified leads, where 258 come from marketplaces, 394 come from paid, and 180 come from SEO [channel conversion rates since inception were used to calculate this]. Alternatively, we could double our conversion rate at the bottom of the funnel and all of these numbers seem a lot more achievable. Given that we've identified a lot of low hanging fruit at the bottom of the funnel in the last month [post click drip, making sure people know they are getting approved] I'm confident that we'll have more success focusing on the bottom of the funnel versus the top]. W/r to contractors, this month will be about identifying messaging and channels for contractor acquisition. Next month will be about closing loans via contractors.\\n\\nOn another, broader note, one thing we have not captured in our goals is our understanding of the customer. We have made a ton of progress in terms of understanding where the market is for our product, but we're nowhere near understanding the customer to the point where we can do hyper targeted and repeatable acquisition. This quarter needs to be about making sure we're instrumenting our customer data as well as meeting and hearing from our customers. The surveys were an excellent start, but this will require us leaving the office, and going to Florida to talk to converted leads and contractors as well as the great work Brandon is doing arranging calls with closed loans.\\n\\nThe first week of the year and things are looking up! To a great year full of resolve!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Becky brings a huge amount of experience to our team, in particular she has developed a retention playbook at her former company for annual churn without having historical data. She\\'s also extremely customer focused, which is precisely more of what we need! We also launched our insurance beta test, and had our first customers reach out to Kelly for their insurance consultation -- actually Kelly also signed up Liberty Mutual and a couple of other new insurance companies this week too, very strong week on that front. Brandon made his mark with a strong webinar performance that I hear resulted in a significant improvement in engagement on the back end. The engineering team is humming away at the new version of our App, product brought on a new full time designer (!!) who starts April 8th, Outbound made a come back and started testing their new script, we had the first of many inbound/marketing syncs and on and on. Good week over all, with a lot of movement.\\n\\nThis week also had its hiccups as most weeks do. Its interesting to observe the company grow and the challenges evolve. One of the things that becomes clear over time is the extent to which one needs to be constantly revisiting assumptions internally. At this point, the main organizational challenges we have internally are around cross department communication and making sure that everyone has all the information they need, one, and two making sure that everyone in the company knows that this is a company but its also a start up. So lets break that down.\\n\\n(1) Problem: Inter department communication // Solution: Give people the benefit of the doubt folks!\\n\\nSounds like a very corporate subject, but it happens to be descriptive so please spare me your ire. Everybody is working hard and solving problems and we need to make sure that the team broadly understands what other departments are doing and why -- especially as the company grows, changes made in one department can have very significant effects on another. This is going to be an iterative process and we all have a lot to learn here. The key to making this successful is giving your team mates the \"benefit of the doubt\". So when something doesn\\'t make sense or you think it could be improved, you should start by asking why it is the case and what the thinking was versus assuming the issue is with someone\\'s competence or that they havent thought of your idea, another possibility is that since the company has evolved so quickly, the other person simply did not consider your perspective, not out of malice but rather out of a maniacal focus on what they are doing. This is critical especially in a repeated game like inter department sessions [I really hate this terminology]. Just remember, everyone is here to make the company succeed, but at the same time we want to ensure that that doesnt happen at the expense of people\\'s individual ability to succeed and operate with excellence.\\n\\n(2) Know this is a start up\\n\\nOne observation I\\'ve made since being back is the company has \"stiffened\" in a key way. One way this manifests is that people tend to contextualize everything within the hierarchy established at the company, which is actually fairly standard. But it has negative effects on the companies ability to function. How this manifests in my role is that sometimes people are reluctant to point out whats not working or what they need help on when in a meeting with me -- which makes sense, generally speaking you\\'d want to give the impression that everything is under control and smooth sailing. But that misses the key point which is that I\\'m here to help solve problems, not judge people on the problems that are developed in their work. Problems, issues, challenges are normal and it is always 10 times more impressive to me when someone is aware of what the really important problems to solve are versus someone who is telling me everything is smooth sailing all the time. It was with this dynamic in mind that I established the value \"Truth\", because its so important that people be operating from a place of getting to the truth rather than posturing -- posturing creates politics -- truth creates results. We\\'re all in this together. Dont forget that! Ping me with whatever you think could be improved, thats what I\\'m here to help drive -- improvement, growth, iteration -- the numbers and the actual revenue growth of the business is a consequence of that process. Every single month was a different set of problems and challenges, and every month we address them to find a solution.\\n\\nI have a feeling we\\'re going to have a completely wild week this week in terms of our results, I hope you all had some time to rest before the last big push of the quarter!\\n\\nLets get it!\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We dove into a lot of interesting data which told us a bit more\\nabout which customers are highly engaged and which are not. Aaron did some\\nfantastic work along with Lindsey to pin down some independent variables (BBB\\naccreditation) that shows a high correlation to the type of behavior we’d like\\nto see in the product.\\n\\nFast paced couple of days in Austin where we’re excited to\\nannounce some new roles going into August. I’ll leave it to Scott to share the\\nnews with everyone, but its always great to see people who grab opportunities\\nwhere they arise. I spent a good amount of the week diving into matters related\\nto Customer Success – I’m pleased with some of the early results we’re seeing\\nthere and happy with where the team is headed thanks in large part to Travis’\\nleadership and initiative. This new path to 10 and onboarding goal is going to\\nrequire us to spend a lot more time instrumenting what we’re using our\\nresources towards (i.e who are we training/why/what is the priority) but we\\nhave a lot of the systems in place to do this reliably and effectively.\\n\\nWe also welcome our second hire to our insurance project this\\ncoming week. Kelly has done a great job getting this off the ground and it\\nlooks like it could shape up to be a good month from a sales perspective on\\nthat front, with some bigger accounts in the pipeline. I’m excited to see this\\nmove forward.\\n\\nWe were sad to lose Brian and Natalie this week. Natalie did\\na great job handing over her responsibilities but please allow for a bit of\\nleeway as I’m sure things will be a bit less smooth with her out. Although\\nKate, her replacement, begins in late August and I’m excited for everyone to\\nmeet her. We will miss her and I think I speak for everyone in wishing her the\\nbest in her new adventure in Miami.\\n\\nBrian’s departure was a surprise to many of us on the team. Although\\nI did not have the opportunity to discuss it with him, we were able to get some\\ninsight about his departure from his exit interview. This is a company that\\npushes hard and where a lot of things change quickly. For those of you who have\\nbeen here for a while you can look back and point to what has changed and grown\\nover time, but for newer hires its easy to look at something and think oh god\\nthis wont change. But the key thing about our company, and frankly the reason\\nbehind our logo, is that we’re adaptable to change. We’re always tweaking and\\ntinkering with our internal processes and responding to feedback. Its really\\ncritical that we understand how things are going from as many perspectives as\\npossible so that we can design better solutions to whatever problems there are\\nand grow as a company as a result. I should have done a better job making sure\\nthat Brian knew that we were receptive to his feedback, I don’t believe he\\nwould have left had he known how quick we\\xa0\\nare to make changes for the better. This is a tough lesson for the\\ncompany, but an important one. For those of you in Austin obviously Scott, Travis\\nand Cassie are always available to take any of your feedback and we do take it\\nincredibly seriously and try to be very responsive.\\n\\nAlas, it is all part of the journey of building a great\\ncompany. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. When you lose, you have to\\nfigure out how to learn from it and use it towards securing a much larger and\\nlonger lasting victory. The good news is that we rarely repeat mistakes!\\n\\nAugust is going to be a very important month for us as a company\\nand we need to get ready to push everything to the next level. Our product and\\nengineering is in better shape than it has ever been, our marketing is synced\\nup, our CS organization is ready to go and our sales engine is larger than\\never. We had a rough couple of months, but for August we have no excuses. We\\nneed to go and secure a victory greater than anything we’ve seen before. All\\nhands on deck, we’re going to show everyone what it means to be a winning\\ncompany. Last August we were able to grow 40% relative to July, I hope this is\\nno different!\\n\\nLooking forward to that!\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

I was really impressed with the amount that got done but also with the initiative that was taken by everyone in the company to get it done well and on time. Thank you all for that, I think its a very good sign for the company and a testament to the culture that we've collectively built here.\\n\\nWe're still lagging behind a bit on our quarterly goals with respect to closed loans, but we're getting a ton of inbound on the qualified lead front. I think the key to converting more is going to come through understanding which cohorts of customers are most likely to convert and focusing on them. Once we can predictably close that specific cohort we can move outwards to marginally less high intent users and so on until we can get our broad conversion rate up dramatically. John did a great job synthezing and studying a lot of the demographic data we have, and I'm excited to see what the property data reveals about our channels, our funnel and ultimately our conversion.\\n\\nAs we head into the last week of the month, I'm feeling optimistic about the quarter. I think we've had a tremendous amount of focus and discipline over the course of the last month, and there is a much stronger energy than we had at the end of the year. Thank you all for bringing your best to work every day. Lets keep it up as we have a lot more work to do.\\n\\nJacob asked me to talk about our quarterly goals specifically in these e-mails and I think he was right to suggest that. A couple of weeks ago I suggested a break down of our ambitious quarterly goals where we closed 35 loans this month. 10 from marketplaces, 5 from SEO, and 20 from paid.\\n\\nWe're tracking at 11 closed loans this month, but I think that we're likely to see a couple come in before the month is out, as we have many pending loans.\\n\\nStarting with marketplaces -- the big change has come in going from not converting any to converting 1. We flipped buildzoom back to white label which has been a game changer, and I hope we get a couple of more loans off them before the monthis out. That being said I think its going to be a reach to get to 10. My sense is that as we understand what cohorts convert, we're going to start to iterate on our messaging to attract that type of person and that will help us with conversion.\\n\\n2. SEO has been tracking extremely well. My understanding is that we're at 4 closed loans from SEO. Some of those come from the AC financing page that brandon spun up many months ago. Brandon has had the vision and rigor to set this infrastructure up long ago, and its exciting to see this come together so well. I suspect we may hit our SEO target for the month. One project that is worth mapping out in the coming week is AC financing itself, to see if there are merchants in that category that are interested and willing to have us as a financing partner.\\n\\n3. Paid -- we're still grappling with paid, but there is positive momentum there. A lot of our closed and pending loans came from paid this month, that being said we're not anywhere near our goal of getting to 20 -- I believe we're at 6. More may well come in before the end of the month. That being said, given that our main channel is facebook, the more we understand about who to target, the closer we're going to be to hitting this goal two months from now [40 from paid], and there are some positive signs there.\\n\\nBroadly speaking, I feel as though we're tracking across a lot of our critical objectives. Lots of great work this week. Lets blow it out of the water next week!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

       "  \"Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, March 18, 2018 1:15:37 PM GMT-07:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nteam@shoguninc.com\\n\\nHi everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nHope you're all having a great weekend and getting some rest before the penultimate week of the quarter! We've got to drive hard in these last couple of weeks to get to our goal of $20,000 monthly revenue. We're very close but as we've seen this weekend nothing can be taken for granted, things turn on and off and we've got to be nimble enough to adapt and make what we have work. That being said we're still tracking about 3k ahead in terms of getting to 20k.\\n\\nWe're continuing to see really positive signs of product market fit, with the great note that we got at the beginning of the week from the lady whose roof we helped finance to the contractor who by his own accord uploaded an awesome video evangelizing our product to his customers. I'm also encouraged to see that our volumes have not stopped growing despite us completely turning Facebook off this month. Some excellent momentum across a lot of the core aspects of our company. Amidst all of this, I was really impressed with the Nikhil, David and Steph finding the time to proactively map out the engagement flow in more detail as well as flesh out some key ideas like us building an app and what contractor levels could look like. We also closed a couple of new contractor loans which is exciting, figuring out what the triggers are there is going to be a key to make this business grow the way that we want it to. And perhaps most notably we had an exciting new member of our team join us this week -- Scott! Scott is all geared up and ready to kick start our sales org first thing when he gets in from Austin on Monday morning. Special shout out\\xa0 to Zak for crushing the credit card step tweaks in one day on Friday. Not to mention some really great momentum with a couple of potentially game changing business partners coming close to fruition -- lightstream and thumbtack.\\n\\nObviously\\xa0 with the good comes the bad. In start ups as we've collectively learned over the course of the last couple of month there is always a next biggest problem. As we solve one big problem another emerges. We need to be really critical about pulling these problems out to the fore as we map out our strategy and making sure that we're not overemphasizing the positive momentum. A couple of times this week it genuinely felt as though we'd already crossed 20k, but numbers dont lie -- we have not! And if we decide on any type of growth next month, we need to be sure that we're staying as paranoid as possible until the goals have been achieved! I'd say one of our biggest problems, the one that we need to work on and make sure to prioritize next month -- is we have no way of evaluating our engagement. We dont know if its good, although a lot of us have the sense it could be better. And we're going to have to work to identify ways of making it stronger over time. In order to do that we're going to have to bring instrumentation to that entire process, just like any other funnel. Anthony V did a great job sources two excellent CS candidates that are coming in on Monday. We're going to need to dedicate resources to this as at the end of the day we expect this to be our core business. Not to mention that we still have a lot to learn on Facebook. Brandon, being Brandon, spent hours yesterday pouring over our entire funnel and reading up on facebook ad dynamics. We're lucky to have you on our team Brandon! But we're not only going to have to figure out how to manage that channel as Christopher mentioned in SoS, but we're also more importantly going to have to figure out how to scale it without destroying performance. That is the truly tricky part. If we get to 20k this month, that would be great, but at the end of the day the only revenue that truly matters is revenue that is scale-able and which we can control. As long as our predictive ability is not there AND the channels that drive us revenue dont scale [Buildzoom Direct to Consumer right now] then there isnt much we can do with these funnels long term. We need to keep that in mind across the entire company as we decide what to invest our time in.\\n\\nOverall things are looking up! Get some rest before a big week next week! Lots to cover including the affiliate program, the upsell funnel for our existing $30 a month customers, more work to map out how engagement has been working and launching our sales org!\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

We’re currently tracking for around 71k, but we usually catch up a bit of the weekend early in the week so I think our goal of crossing 83k is still in sight.\\n\\nMore substantively, we made material progress on the app, salesforce, monthly payment estimator and the loan application all the while running some front end tests which seem to have resuscitated self serve. I believe we’ve had 6 or so self serve plans come in this weekend, which is something we haven’t seen for a while ! Great work Brandon on staying disciplined here, we’ve learned a ton from our April approach.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some meaningful progress on key fronts like the office [both SF and Austin], expanding our credit offering, unlocking new channels and unleashing insurance this week. Next week will reveal a lot more across these fronts ! I’m headed to Austin to visit the eastern front on Tuesday and will be out of the office on Friday but hope to see a lot of our efforts come together this week - mainly the app getting to a place where we can release it!\\n\\nLooking forward to seeing you all bright and early tomorrow !\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Of course, for those that were honorable enough to call me before publishing this information I responded by saying that no, the company had not received those funds. Honorable is not how I would describe the majority of the journalists I have dealt with, unfortunately — although there are some. The consequence is that in the Japanese Media and in the French media, with occasional errors being put forward in major western outlets like bloomberg saying that this company has been funded through some sort of illegal scheme with the money originating from Nissan. This is not a new rumor. This is something that I’ve seen coming since early November when journalists started to poke around and call some of my friends asking where the company was funded from [btw this is an ironic and unfortunate consequence of not announcing our funding rounds]. I had many conversations internally and with the board about this and they have been very supportive especially given that the allegations are totally incorrect and unsubstantiated. At one point I asked a reporter where she got the basis for the allegation — she replied that she had two anonymous sources inform her. I told her that she would be irresponsible to publish that, and she replied saying that she’d qualify it as an “allegation” which of course is totally mundane and irrelevant but speaks to the challenge of unwinding some of these rumors especially when your enemies control huge global multi billion dollar companies. In any case — in so far as this had come up on any of your radars I wanted to assure you that it is untrue and not even a question.\\n\\nHaving lived through about 4 months of this type of thing, I can tell you it will pass very quickly. The good news is that our investors know this is fake, the board is very supportive of us and one of the benefits of the company and brand being delineated is that there is no affect on the customer or brand. Although obviously I really am sorry that this has come to the point where Shogun has been drawn into it even somewhat peripherally. It is the nature of war, and our enemies are using every tool, trick and hack to get my dad to break including dragging his children into the affair hoping that it will destablize us and as a consequence him. Of course, they made a error in their calculations because I will not bow to their tactics. If anything, this bad joke has only served to redouble my resolve.\\n\\nI just wanted to make sure that everyone knows — the claims they are making are baseless and the company does not carry any risk associated with what is being “investigated”.\\n\\nI’m sorry that this is even a subject, when I started this company I never even imagined for one second that this would be something that could happen. I take this and all other challenges as lessons and opportunities to grow stronger. This is a tough period for me and my family but I’m fueled with the knowledge that this test will make sense in retrospect and is full of valuable lessons for what I know will be a much bigger mission. Until then, please feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to speak about this in more detail and dont be concerned as there really is nothing to this.\\n\\nWarmly,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

We're moving a lot of balls forward at the same time which can be hectic, but most things are progressing along very well. This week we welcomed Anthony Amelio and Francis Scott McKee to our team in Austin! Anthony and Scott, a warm welcome from everyone here -- we're excited that you've joined this adventure with us. We also extended 3 offers to new customer success managers in Austin all of whom accepted, Anthony and Stephanie did a great job sorting top candidates for this batch and they'll be joining us later in the month. We also had a great onsite with stephan on the engineering side that I think we're all excited about.\\n\\nWe're making slow and steady progress on channel partnerships, still mired in the legal back and forth with HomeAdvisor over taking over Prosper's exclusive channel partnership there. We've sent Buildzoom an updated proposal for them to review, but hopefully we can see that one come through in Q4. We had some unfortunate hiccups with SRS where they were supposed to send out an email blast but their marketing department has not done that yet. SRS is a 3 billion dollar company and it looks like they have their top marketing exec running point on this, which explains why he may not have gotten to it when he said he would. I'm in New Jersey on \\n\\nMonday\\xa0kicking off our pilot with GAF, the largest roofing supply company in the country, which I'm excited about -- there is a lot of potential there. We had our fist pilot on-boarding session this week, and the group turned out to already be using Hearth which was pretty cool. They have a loan deep in the funnel that I hope will convert with Best Egg, but overall they were positive on the experience so far. Interesting case where they had been introduced to us through GAF, but we'd already signed them out through our outbound efforts and they had also been approached by Hover. We're starting to get into the market aggressively and hit customers from multiple valid points which I think will make it easier to convert them. We're moving Hover to a paid trial which I'm optimistic about and still working through the deal terms with Advantaclean. Kevin is working on some cool projects with Madsky too that I'm optimistic about. All in all we're moving the ball forward. In the meantime, marketing is doing a great job on facebook where we've been able to scale our facebook spend but also reduce the per lead costs associated with inside sales. On outbound sales, we made 4 sales this week with Clayton the king closing 2 in a day which is a company record for outbound. I think that we'll start to see the results from outbound in the late half of this month as the sales cycles are longer, but Shea pointed something out to me in Austin which was encouraging -- 1/4 of our outbound demos close which is a big deal and an encouraging sign as we still dont have much data.\\n\\nIn terms of the product and engineering, the big milestone this week was launching the app. Thank you in particular to Zak and John who I know were in late debugging the android deployment. These  acts of commitment to excellence are so critical to the fabric of our culture, and we all really appreciate you both setting the example. We also managed to squeeze in an Upstart integration, so hopefully we'll go live with a new lender this coming week. Nikhil, Saya and David have done a great job mapping out what we're pushing for on the product side this month -- I'm excite to see how invoicing, max qual and gamification affect engagement across the board. These are going to be critical to driving usage through our product and from my conversations with contractors, I'm very optimistic that they will provide them with a lot of value.\\xa0\\n\\nOverall we're chugging along as we aim for new heights this month. I'm optimistic we'll get there.\\xa0\\n\\nWarmly,\\xa0\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman\"),\n",

This is the next generation of our company, it itegrates virtually all of the lessons that we've learned on this windy path of building a company. I'm proud of the work we did here, and really appreciative of all of you who worked extra hard to make sure it came out on time. A lot of the long nights and debates fueled what I believe is a totally unique product that has the potential to take us far along in terms of our vision. The work you put in is a key example of us putting Shogun first and executing quietly without cinema.\\n\\nIn the spirit of inclusion and clearly communicating where we stand, we had a really productive culture meeting where a lot of important issues came out. I think these discussions are difficult, often inconclusive, and generally speaking end with two differing views on the same issue. My view is that this is healthy, the friction is a natural part of the growing pains that hopefully will result in us taking more intentional control of our future and what it means for people down the line to work here at Shogun. The company is little more than the collection of people we've brought around the table, and our ability to zoom out and figure out whats working and whats not working is going to be instrumental in terms of helping us attract and retain future hires.\\n\\nAnother brief aside here on culture as there are some high level thoughts that I missed the opportunity to express. My objective is to create the best work environment for every one on this team possible. We are very early in the process of building a company, and a lot of this is new to all of us. I really appreciate each one of you taking the time to bring up issues you had as it helps guide thinking and engender improvements. Its very important to me that we create a values driven team couched in a sense of excellence. In this effort I am totally aligned and I encourage every one of you to share thoughts and feedback with me regularly. I may not agree with all of it, but I will certainly listen and engage and explain why where I disagree.\\n\\nOn the subject of future hires -- we have closed Stefano, an engineering intern. These processes are never straight forward, we had a bit of a hick up on the way there, but I'm glad that we're going to be able to welcome someone as talented, excited and humble onto our team.\\n\\nIn terms of the metrics -- we've closed 85K of loans this month, which beats 75k which were at last month, and 50k which we were at in September. This is a strong sign that some of what we're doing is working, but we're far from our objective. This weekend I've been reflecting a lot on what we need to accomplish as a company and how to think about our goals. As many of you know our goal this quarter was to close 100 loans, which we're not close to -- I believe we're at 5 or 6 for the quarter so far, and we're nearing the mid point. We still need to figure out how to close these more predictably and I have a couple of ideas re: how. One of which is to massively up the bounty on people who leave the loans page and the offers page so that we can better understand our customers. Brandon and the engineering team have done a great job getting this up and running quickly. I would pay someone handsomely if they could straight out just give me the answers to why we're losing people, and I think this is no different, so I think it merits a bigger budget. At a high level, we need to close something closer to 1000 loans a month in order to be break even at our current costs. I think that this is not the right goal given that a lot of our work has to do with investing in growth, and that we can prove our business model with something like 500 loans a month. Both of which we're currently far from, but we're a lot closer than we were last quarter. This process is frustrating and time consuming, but the pay off is enormous. The difficulty in figuring this out is the key to creating value for our partners -- digital distribution into the segment is broken fragmented, and doesnt have a scalable channel. When we figure this out we can create a lot of value by sharing it with our partners.\\n\\nOn the licensing side things are progressing, and its looking like we're getting closer to finding terms that are fair to both 8VC and the DBO. Our goal of being licensed in California was achieved this week thanks in large part to Anthony V's ingenuity, creativity and execution. He went out and found Charlie and then processed the entire license process with him. Brilliant. Thank you Anthony.\\n\\nFor reference, I will start copying our goals at the end of this weekly e-mail and bringing them up at the State of the Start Up.\\n\\n•500 Qualified Leads a month in December\\n\\nClose 100 Loans\\n\\n•Sell a credit card lead\\n\\n500 Qualified Leads a month in December\\n\\n•Licensed in CA, TX, NJ, OH, CT and NC for\\nloan brokerage.

We went from launching our first landing page second week of February to salesforce tracking, ltv calculators, running 3 tests a week and managing 500 contractors in a matter of 2.5 months. Really impressive work from everyone. We've got to keep this up, this opportunity is a blessing, we could have found ourselves hustling for another year or two before we had our shot, it came now, and so far we've stepped up. The key to continuing the momentum is everyone bringing 100% every day and continuing to approach our biggest challenges with a constructive mindset. Its also important that during this period of intense growth where we're all pushing ourselves and bringing on new people, that we stay intentional about our culture which is why I appreciate everyone taking the time to fill out the culture survey and spending the time to engage in our culture sync this coming week. Culture eats strategy for breakfast, and its important to stay on top of it in good times because it really counts in bad times which we all know will come in one shape or another.\\n\\nWe're pacing really well across a lot of different fronts, excited to bring on a couple new lenders hopefully in the coming month or two as well as new marketplaces/platforms we can work with. I'm on with SRS this week, and after a lot of back and forth with buildzoom we're going to end up working with them on contractor acquisition.\\n\\nReally amazing growth on the loans side which is honestly fantastic. Stephanie has been doing a fantastic job setting our contractors up for success, which looks like its massively paying off. 17 loans in 4 days is an all time record for us. Hopefully it keeps up.\\n\\nLooking forward to seeing everyone next week! Hope you all have a great weekend and get some rest in the mean time.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

       "  'Weekly Update\\n\\nSunday, August 11, 2019 2:00:15 PM GMT-07:00\\n\\nAnthony Ghosn <anthony@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nTeam <team@shoguninc.com>\\n\\nHi everyone,\\xa0\\n\\nGood week this week, made some meaningful progress on our core strategy of guiding users to get 10 completes. Hopefully next week we\\'ll see it come through in the product, excited to start to get data on how we can drive outcomes for the small businesses we work with. I thought I\\'d use today\\'s weekly update to talk about what I look at in terms of business metrics for engagement.\\n\\nThe first thing I look at is the % of a cohort that has gotten a funded loan in the last month. A cohort is the set of users that the company brought on in a given month. So if in April we brought on 400 contractors, how many contractors have funded a loan 3 months later (in august). This tells us how many contractors have been able to reach the value moment within our product journey and its an important leading indicator for things like churn and life time value of the contractor. Of our April cohort customers that have already been around for 3 months, 28% of them have funded a loan. Now this is a good and bad thing. Its bad because I think we all share the sense that it could be higher than that, although there are obviously extraneous factors that determine when an account funds a loan, we\\'d like to be able to drive a higher proportion of our contractors to successfully offer financing in the first 3 months. Its good because that is the highest % that we\\'ve ever had. If you\\xa0 look at the behavior of the cohorts for the last 18 or so months, never once have we successfully gotten 28% of our contractors to a funded loan in their first three months. For context, the number for April 2017 (in terms of the % that funded a loan in the first three months) is 16.5%. That is a pretty significant increase, whats more, that is true for virtually every single one of the last 4 months of cohorts that have gotten a funded loan. Our February cohort which has 36.6% of people who have funded a loan, is the best cohort we\\'ve ever had, including the cohorts before that in terms of the % of contractors that have funded a loan. What I mean here is that all of the cohorts that are coming up to their 12 month renewal metrics, none of them have had as high a % that have funded as the February cohort from 2019 has now (6 months in). So there is a clear trend that we\\'re doing a much better job at activating our cohorts than ever before, and that trend continues to hold for the newer cohorts.\\n\\nThe other metric I look closely at is called \"loan retention\". What it shows us is who is funding the loans in any given month. Every month, most of our funded loans come from new users (either just signed on or funded a loan for the first time). Last month, of the 294 accounts that have funded a loan (so far) 171 of them did so for the first time. Here is the good news, 70 of them have funded a loan before (but not last month). We call them resurrected users, meaning that they were active at one point but showed no funded loan volume the prior month (June). This number has steadily been going up. Comparing it to February, where we had only resurrected 23 users. My favorite group to look at is the \"retained\" users, meaning that the users here had funded a loan the prior month (in June) and then funded a loan again in July. These are our highest value customers as they have demonstrated the habit of offering financing successfully. 53 organizations that funded in July had funded in June! Up from February where only 14 organizations that funded in February had funded in January as well.\\n\\nThere are many different projects, e-mail tests, copy tests, ui tests, new features etc that contribute to this overall tide of higher engagement. And unlike revenue which is very easy to see increasing, engagement can be a harder metric to measure. I wanted to share this with you all to say that we\\'re making steady and meaningful progress on driving higher engagement through our user base. This is going to be a time consuming effort and its going to be something we\\'re going to achieve through a thousand tactics versus silver bullets but it looks like we\\'re headed in the right direction!\\n\\nHope this is a useful frame to think about the business!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",

Two weeks away from the end of the quarter and 7 qualified leads away from beating last months high. We're on track to double our lead count again this month. Its going to take a lot of pushing, but at this rate its looking like we might be able to meet what was an ambitious goal. I'm really proud of everyone for putting in the work on this. Its been incredible to see the company reinvent itself every single quarter. As we approach the 1-year mark as a company I've been reflecting on what each quarter meant for us and how we've changed and evolved. I'll likely do a deeper dive into my thoughts and learnings next week, as I think that we learned a ton of hard lessons that are worth making part of the company's DNA. Jumping back to the topic though -- 188 qualified leads is what we need in order to have doubled our count again. At my last board meeting, on June 1st, we were at a cumulative 5 qualified leads, we didnt have a comprehensive vision for the product as it develops over the coming years, we hadnt spoken to any real customers who had pain points we were solving, and we were having trouble even getting people to complete the application form off of buildzoom [much less thinking about qualified leads]. Its important to take stock of what we did this quarter. Of the fact that we literally picked ourselves up from that, we faced the massive uncertainty, angst and frustrated disappointment but we nonetheless maintained our resolve. Now we're much stronger for it.\\xa0\\n\\nDoes that mean we're done? Of course not. This is just the beginning. Next quarter we're going to look back with the same perspective. Instead of 5 qualified leads, we'll reflect on the 5 closed loans. It may seem crazy to say that by the end of this year I want us to be at $1m run rate. But guess what -- it was crazy to think that we could double our monthly qualified lead rates every month. It seemed impossible to be where we are today, only a short period of time ago. Every quarter we're going to get stronger, more confident and more dominant. The key to doing this isnt slapping ourselves on the back, but recognizing that problems can be solved with disciplined testing, a focus on breaking down concerns into actionable steps, and a collective willingness to come together and improve. If we can keep this up, there is no stopping us.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen we started the company, I had no doubt what the logo would be. Some of you may not know where it came from or what its supposed to mean. The symbol is meant to embody the opposite of a circle, where a circle represents making the same mistake/decision over and over again. Its meant to embody the concept of learning through trying and continuous development. A year into the company, reflecting on all the crazy highs and lows, I'm proud to say I think we've earned that logo, we've embodied it. Continuing to embody it will not be easy. As we get better, we'll have more to lose. As we get more confident, we'll be less inclined to learn. The future of this company isnt a straight line to the top. Its a journey, filled with surprise and disappointment, accomplishment and failure, thwarted ambitions and 11th hour saves. But we have the team to take this company the distance, I believe that wholeheartedly. Every single one of you has earned the right to be here. I've seen it first hand in working with you all to address areas of improvement. This company gets better as we get better. First as individuals, then as teams and finally as a company.\\xa0\\n\\nSo here we are, two weeks away. \\n\\nWe've got this.\\xa0\\n\\nGodspeed,\\n\\nAnthony\\n\\nSent via \\n\\nSuperhuman\"),\n",

Some big milestones and projects came to a close like the audit which both Anthony and Parker spent an enormous amount of time on. We also were able to launch some new initiatives like steve's renewal script in CS, see a bit more data on our new offers page, and move our homeowner data into salesforce so that we can make sure we're doing the best by our contractors once they sign on. April was a strong month for us with around 20% growth. We also kicked off some preliminary meetings to start attracting more capital to the business -- so far so good. Its been a helpful exercise because its also forced me to map out how we get this company to $100m in revenue or even $500m. We're in an exciting place as a business and it really feels as though we're in the very early innings of something very unique.\\n\\nFor those of you who havent already I'd strongly recommend you\\n\\nwatch the video that Zak put together and sent out as part of the product & engineering update -- it was a good reminder for me of the real work we're doing and its effect in the world. I'm confident that with some of our latest projects around engagement we're going to be able to drive even more value through our work over the next year. My broad sense is that we're on pace to be about 3 or 4 times our current size in the next 12-15 months which is a really rapid pace of growth even in our space.\\n\\nNow that we're entering into the actual season, it'll be interesting to see our loan volume grow. We've managed to grow it by 3x since February which is pretty great -- on an annual basis at this rate we would be originating over 60m in loans!\\n\\nLooking forward to catching up with everyone in Austin next week -- in the mean time enjoy this:\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\\xa0\\xa0\"),\n",

Before I get into everything I want to give Shea a special shout out for closing 3 outbound deals in one day -- thats truly amazing and a testament to her work and excellence -- thank you Shea for setting the bar as usual! Speaking of outbound we got a new script from our friend Steve Weyl that is looking good -- Steve is also working on some videos that will come out hopefully next week. Its a series of 6 videos on how to build a roofing business [btw Steve is the founder of Able Roof, largest residential roofing business in the country and built it to over 100m a year in revenue]. On this thread, I went down to LA on Wednesday evening to meet Dmitry, who is another highly influential person in the roofing industry -- I didnt realize this but his youtube channel roofing insights has over 17,000 roofers on it. I'm going to Minnesota to do a couple of videos with him this Wednesday, looking forward to that. We're starting to work on building more of a community and we should try hard to integrate and align key leaders in the industries we approach so that we continue to build a pro small business/enablement driven brand. FYI the sales team is pacing at 95% of for this month! Pretty great!\\n\\nZooming out in terms of the larger projects going on -- we completed and slotted in our new onboarding as well as moved our core customer details features forward this week. We set up a new system for CS to be alerted when bad outcomes happen for accounts that they are assigned -- like a first complete resulting in a rejection. Brandon, Nikhil, Saya and Lindsey have done amazing work mapping out a new engagement funnel that is genuinely compelling and we'll like be rolling out in the coming week or so. We've also ordered most of the new furniture and aligned on a move out date towards our new SF office, very excited about that. We should be fully moved out by the end of the month. Anthony and I have been moving the AMS deal along, hopefully that closes next week -- we've set that as the timeframe for finalizing the negotiation. That means we're likely to start integrating them in November. Big big win for us as well this month in signing Anna Fabian, VP, Product at SoFi on to join us starting in December as SVP of Product. I'm really looking forward to that, as she brings a variety of experiences to the table including having been one of the very first to work on SoFi's personal loan product and growing that business to over 100m in originations the first year. We also signed William, our newest engineer this week -- congrats to Zak and everyone on that. Whats more we went live on HomeAdvisor this friday and are starting to see some light traffic from that, the bigger integrations that hopefully will move the needle will come soon. Our team attended RCAT, which was a texas roofing convention this week too -- thank you to Chuck and Kevin for making the trip out there.\\n\\nWe're firing on all cylinders here. We still have a long ways to go towards our objectives, but after having reviewed some of the work that Brandon spearheaded in terms of thinking about engagement, I'm feeling confident that we'll come out of this quarter with not only a stronger product and business, but a more sophisticated way of evaluating and building towards customer outcomes.\\n\\nExcited to see everyone tomorrow -- in the mean time have a great weekend.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nAnthony\"),\n",

Probably best to start with the things that could be going better and how we\\'re addressing them. I think the first thing that we\\'re all probably tracking closely is our cash income numbers for the month, which is a bit behind where we collectively want to be at this point. There are a number of reasons for this as I\\'ve mentioned earlier, particularly the fact that we simultaneously made so many changes at the beginning of the month as well as reconciling our new pricing plan with our existing marketing and sales strategy. There was always going to be a big learning curve here, but we\\'re climbing that curve quickly. We saw self serve start to rear its beauty very briefly this week as we on-boarded consumer acquisitions which is charged with running our facebook ad campaigns. Similarly, in Austin we came together and decided that next week will be an all hands on deck week, meaning that we\\'re going to be using the full power of the entire sales team to try to see what we can close maximally in one week. I think thats going to create some significant lift, and I appreciate everyone theres tireless work. We had paired down our campaign spending until around mid this week, so we are where we are having spent probably about 1/3rd of the budget throughout the course of this month on generating inside leads, we will be using the subsequent 2/3rds in the list period of the month, and I think that will help create more tail winds for the sales teams\\' work. I want to deliver the 100k cash in bank figure by the end of the month, not because its strategically important, but rather because I think we should deliver a 1000x year over year as a company -- in July of last year we made our first $100 [the only revenue we had that entire month] At its core we are delivering on ARR, where we are just about where we were last month with a strong prospect of growing the new ARR we\\'re adding by the end of the month.\\n\\nOn engagement, we\\'ve seen some progress but not a whole lot. We have reduced our inactive rate by over 10% [from 45% to 40%] from the beginning of the quarter which is no small feat, but I think there is a broad consensus that there is a lot more we can do to combat inactivity going forward. I\\'m excited that we\\'re seeing that 10% of connected outbound calls to inactive contractors result in an action being taken, amongst other things and am really excited about the potential for our new direct mail engagement campaign that should go out this week. We\\'ve also brought on two additional customer success managers to help us activate our network, they are going to be starting in our Austin office in early August. I think that they will give us the bandwidth we need to on-board and engage our contractors for this next phase of the company and having met both of them I am very excited at the prospect of their joining the company. Things are moving and shaking, but as with all investments it can take time to see the payoff.\\n\\nOn the positive side, we launched our first channel partnership campaign which resulted in a new contractor. We all agree there is much more to do there, but this is a milestone for us as we make channel partnerships a key strategy for contractor acquisition. We also got the fantastic news that Stefano\\'s visa was approved and as a result he will be joining us full time upon his return! Conversations with prosper are going in a fantastic direction with respect to accessing HomeAdvisor\\'s database of contractors as well as leveraging their brand in partnership with ours. We have put in several letters of intent for new office space in san francisco, which is also itself quite exciting. I also had the opportunity to speak to a candidate to kick off our insurance project, who will give me an answer on Monday! So things are moving along in a healthy way, and there are a lot of great things happening. Obviously we need to keep a focus on what could be going better but its always useful to consider those things that have gone our way. Last but absolutely not least, we are so excited to have brought on Saya this week! Saya welcome! We know you\\'re already moving and shaking things up, and we\\'re excited to see your contributions!\\n\\nI\\'ll spend the last bit here talking about the company itself. As some of you may know, I\\'ve made it a goal for me personally to develop the internal mechanisms for identifying valuable contributions and recognizing strong leaders inside of the company. Nikhil puts it well when he says there is building a company and then there is building a business, both are different and have different challenges/opportunities. In building a company we have the unique opportunity to identify and outline the things that hold us all together as well as our shared values, in order to build a company that is both successful as a business but also and equally importantly, a place where smart people come to grow personally. I\\'ve spent some time thinking about this element, as everyone who is in this company has at some point had a conversation with me where I\\'ve asked -- what is it that you\\'re looking for in your next opportunity, if we can not provide that then I think that there is no fit, but if we can then there is a great fit. In other words, I take it as the most important aspect of a prospective professional relationship that the individuals goals need to align with the role that is being evaluated. I think that this extends deeper into the cycle where we need to be having that conversation on a regular [annual or bi-annual] basis, where we\\'re evaluating whether there is an authentic alignment between a given persons long term goals and their position at the company. Once this link starts to degenerate, it has all sorts of negative consequences for the company and for the individual. So ensuring the that that link is firm, is a critical piece of creating a strong company. And if we can do that well, and systematically, I think that we\\'ll bring together one of the great teams in our industry.\\n\\nI think a reasonable person would pose the question -- well why is this so important. And I\\'ve been thinking about that question a lot, in other words, what follows from the alignment of the individuals goals and pursuits and the company\\'s goals or more specifically that role\\'s goals. So far, my thinking is that it relates back to the dichotomy we\\'ve drawn between gratitude and entitlement. If there is a fit, then the company is lucky to have the individual as that aligns with our goals, and the individual is lucky to have the company, because it aligns with their long term goals, and hopefully gives them a differentiated path there. But lets evaluate the variants. If the person\\'s goals do not align with the company\\'s goals then you have to imagine that there are many instances in which the person is incentivized to take actions that are not in the interest of the company, not only that, you can see why things that seem important to the company do not seem important to the individual. It also creates a dynamic where the company feels it must drag the individual to the outcome it desires or it expects, it creates a dynamic of entitlement with respect to the individual from the company, and leads to \"management\" or petty accountability dynamics. When there is alignment, it creates the opportunity for leadership or a relationship that is defined by mutual growth. If the company\\'s goals are not aligned with the individuals goals, then it follows that there isnt a business case to satisfy that individuals desires and as a consequence you have to either sacrifice the best interest of the business to create that opportunity, or work with the individual to find another pursuit without the company where they can achieve their goals. In this case the individual is acting with entitlement towards the company, expecting it to bend to his or her needs and will. Obviously the middle ground here is reevaluating the entire set of options and seeing if there is a combination that fits both the companys needs and the individuals needs, and this is something we should be doing with each other regularly, because our desires and dreams as individuals change with time as do the company\\'s needs and goals. So in other words in order to avoid an entitlement dynamic, we need to create systems to make sure that there is authentic alignment between the company\\'s goals and the individual goals. There are many ways in which companies are mini societies, and the principals we hold as a company should probably to some degree imitate the principals we hold as a society. As a company, we need to orient ourselves towards thinking about motivations and pursuits of the individual as the catalyst for the company wide pursuits. In other words, it is my strong opinion that the individual pursuit of happiness is itself the genesis of a company\\'s development and success. The extent to which we\\'re able to align that pursuit with our collective goals, is the extent to which we\\'re able to build a fantastic company versus a machine that risks operating at the expense of its parts.\\n\\nThis may seem like a weird thing to opine about in a weekly e-mail, but the reason I am is that I want this company to be more than just a silicon valley start up with many analogues. I think we have the opportunity to build a one in a million business, but I think we also have the opportunity to build a one in a million company, whats more I think that they complement each other and are deeply related.\\n\\nWith that, have a great weekend!\\n\\nAnthony'),\n",
